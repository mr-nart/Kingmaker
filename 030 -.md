## Log

#### getting back to the tuskwater
- we head off by boat towards the tuskwater with a group of surveyors
	- riverboat captain Machan
- the first settlers will come afterwards in about a month

#### stopping at Nivakta's Crossing
- at the inn by mid-day
- green cloak guy (Master Kavin) says he is owed money from Tartuccio because he took a huge advance on a bunch of alcohol
	- 30 gold worth???
		- we'll bring him one of the barrels of wine from the bandits
	- Lander had like a Chalaxian something on his person maybe?
- we reboard the boat and we make its journey down to the Crooked Falls by the end of the day
- we then reach Nettle's crossing by the end of the 2nd day
- by the end of the 3rd day, we reach the Tuskwater Fort

#### Tuskwater Fort
- Hedera's progress:
	- large wooden log palisade around the fort
	- reconstruction of destroyed walls
	- gathered some resources
	- bedchambers restored
	- smells pretty musty though
- the crew starts drawing their weapons at the sight of the kobolds running around
	- we tell them to hold on while we figure out what's going on
	- the kobolds start panicking
	- we call out to Hedera
		- we get a general gist of what the situation is, try to calm the boat's crew and the kobolds
- Hedera warns the kobolds will try to steal whatever they can, so keep a close eye on your belongings
- the surveyors set up their camp near the base of the hill closer to the shore
- planning out the city?
	- docks / merchant area south of the fort at the north shore of the tuskwater?
	- residential up north?
	- lumber yard to the west between the fort and the forest?
- setting up things?
	- Garrett setting up temporary dock
	- Archie setting up a forge in the fort
	- Caine setting up an area for medical care / grooming at base of hill
	- Liosa working up on gathering supplies (lumber)
	- Celestine looking for a good spot for the Orphanage
	- Hedera directing kobolds in helping assist others with setting things up
- the camp grows over the next days, people start roping off areas for construction, some early arrivals trickle in
- makeshift tavern!
	- stories shared at night that talk about some stuff going on
		- the sound of shuffling at night but nothing being there
		- small objects going missing mysteriously
			- did the kobolds take that stuff? Garrett sneaks to the basement to check
				- it's really really pungent (it's as if somebody kept lizards but had no idea how to clean a lizard enclosure)
				- various piles of knick knacks, pretty staggering amount of stuff altogether
				- Hedera will deal with it?
- Hedera's meeting with her 5 favorite kobolds
	- Hedera enlisting them to find a nearby, secretive cave that isn't already occupied (unless they deserve to die)
- some merchants ran into a small skeleton army to the east?
	- need to investigate?
