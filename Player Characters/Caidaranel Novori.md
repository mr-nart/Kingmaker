>A chronic wanderer holding various odd jobs over the course of his long life, Caidaranel Novori (known as "Caine" to most) has been a barber surgeon in southern [[Brevoy]] for the last 35 years. He possesses a keen eye that grants him expertise in haircuts and shaves (as well as a friendly face for the small talk and whispered gossiping that accompany them).
>
>Lately he's had cases of strange injuries brought to his attention -- specific cuts that he notes are highly suspicious for some kind of ritual. Caine has connected these events to the [[Black Tears]], a criminal syndicate based in [[New Stetven]] now headed to [[Restov]]. This lead has led him to a soiree hosted by a Lady [[Jamandi Aldori]]. He's invited himself to the party to investigate further...

## Traits
About 6'0", medium build. Friendly face, long chestnut hair, golden eyes, very observant/intense gaze. Wears sleeve garters reminiscent of barber poles. Makes conversation easily, isn't often the one cracking jokes but is quick to laugh.

## Motivations
Looking to figure out what the [[Black Tears]] are up to.

Largely a wandering soul, but in his recent work as a barber he has developed a strong desire to heal others, related to his worship of [[Deities#Selket]].

## Affiliations
- Maybe familiar w/ some military people of House Rogarvia?
	- Caine is old enough to have been around for the disappearance of [[Historical Figures#Choral the Conqueror]].
- Familiar w/ some peripheral players in Brevic politics?
