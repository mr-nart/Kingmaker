>Originally from Kyonin, **Caidaranel Novori** (known as **Caine** to most), is a chronic wanderer who has held various odd jobs over the course of his long life. Most recently, he has been a *barber surgeon* in southern [[Brevoy]] for the last 30 years or so. He possesses a keen eye that grants him expertise in haircuts and shaves (as well as a friendly face for the small talk and whispered gossiping that accompany them).

>Lately he's had cases of strange injuries brought to his attention -- specific cuts that he notes are highly suspicious for some kind of ritual. Caine has connected these events to the [[Black Tears]], a criminal syndicate based in [[New Stetven]] now headed to [[Restov]]. This lead has led him to a soiree hosted by a Lady [[Jamandi Aldori]]. He's invited himself to the party to investigate further...

## Traits
About 6'0", medium build, olive skin. Friendly face, chestnut hair, golden eyes, very observant/intense gaze. Wears sleeve garters reminiscent of barber poles.

## Motivations
He identifies deeply with the edicts of his adopted deity, [[Deities#Selket]]. He has a strong desire to heal others, but does not refrain from violence when necessary. He holds a *profound respect for the dead*, and he will go out of his way to make corpses look presentable.

## Affiliations

	- Caine is old enough to have been around for the disappearance of [[Historical Figures#Choral the Conqueror]].
- Familiar w/ some peripheral players in Brevic politics?
