>A chronic wanderer holding various odd jobs over the course of his long life, Caidaranel Novori (known as "Caine" to most) has been a barber surgeon in southern [[Brevoy]] for the last 35 years or so. Though he possesses a keen eye that grants him expertise in haircuts and shaves (as well as a friendly face for the small talk and whispered gossiping that accompany them), he is admittedly not the most talented with a scalpel -- but still perfectly serviceable. Lately he's been getting more and more concerned about the ever-increasing frequency of patients injured in lawless encounters in the [[Stolen Lands]] to the south. Not content to just patch up wounds after the fact, Caine's attention has been caught by an intriguing opportunity to help bring order to the region.

## Traits
About 6'0", medium build. Friendly face, long chestnut hair, golden eyes, very observant/intense gaze. Wears sleeve garters reminiscent of barber poles. Makes conversation easily, doesn't often make jokes but is quick to laugh.

## Motivations
Largely a wandering soul, but in his recent work as a barber he has developed a strong desire to heal others, related to his worship of [[Deities#Selket|Selket]].
