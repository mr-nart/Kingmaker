>**Hedera Wildbow** is the only known surviving inhabitant of a village in the woods named Glenwine. She lived there with her husband and three children until a tragic assault on the town occurred, sparing nearly no one. All she knows from that day was that the assailants wore medallions bearing the image of some kind of animal.

>The first day she ever managed to find any kind of lead on the perpetrators was on the *1st of Pharast in the year 4710 AR* upon encountering [[The Staglord]]'s men at [[Oleg's Trading Post]].

## Traits
Tall, dark-haired. Wears military leather armor over plain clothing with a longbow on her back. Seems aloof. Describes herself as "not much of a talker". *Possibly unnecessarily cruel towards bandits/enemies to a problematic extent (carving messages into a prisoner's body, albeit related to her personal history), will require further evaluation.*

## Motivations
Seeking to avenge her fallen loved ones.
