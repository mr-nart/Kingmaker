- Pik'tol was acting strange, repeating "nine nine five" over and over, vomiting vines
- some nearby vines were found that were very different from the other flora in the area
	- seemed to be connected to a nixie named Melianse
	- Hedera talked to Melianse, established some kind of cordial relationship
		- they'll just kind of stay out of each other's hair for now
- Chief Sootscale and Pik'mek examine Pik'tol
	- not much extra info...
- Pik'tol recovered over the next few days, he feels better now
