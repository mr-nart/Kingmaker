 - during the [[Black Tears]]' assault on the Aldori Manor, [[Tartuccio]] gave [[Caidaranel Novori|Caine]] his +1 Ring of Protection in private to aid in battle
 - following the conclusion of the attack, Lady [[Jamandi Aldori]] revealed she had intel regarding the presence of a [[Pitax|Pitaxian]] spy amidst the guests, who perhaps was in cahoots with the Black Tears
 - *Tartuccio accused Caine*, pointing out the aforementioned ring which bears the seal of Pitax
 - despite Caine's suggestion that neither Tartuccio nor Caine take part in the charters, Lady Jamandi insists both participate (in order to keep an eye on them) in opposing parties competing for the [[Documents#Exploration Charter]]
	 - the first party to defeat the bandits in the [[Greenbelt]] region will be awarded the charter
	 - (uhhhh are they gonna investigate further or.....???)
	 - (this plan is so dumb...)
	 - **Our Party:**
		 - PCs + [[Gilda Goodword|Gilda]] + [[Linzi]] + [[Amiri]]
	 - **Lander's Party:**
		 - [[Lander Lebeda|Lander]] + [[Tartuccio]] + [[Valerie]] + [[Jaethal]] + [[Harrim]]

## Tartuk
- On the 5th of Pharast, came across Tartuccio who had disguised himself as a purple kobold, was trying to use the kobolds for some unclear nefarious purpose?
	- something to do with some kind of ritual involving the First World/Fey? using two magical wooden sticks?
	- we captured him and have his journal
		- makes mention of some kind of patron?
- Lander and Valerie were being held captive in the [[Kobold Warrens]] -- where are the others?
