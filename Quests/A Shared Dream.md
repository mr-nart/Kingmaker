- the party experienced a shared dream the night of the *28th of Calistril* while sleeping at [[Oleg's Trading Post]]
	- mist settles low around the trading post
	- out of the mist, a voice saying "help, help, help"
	- green hand reaches out and then fades back into the mist

- On the night of the *1st of Pharast*, we had a similar dream
	- a full arm this time, draped in ivy
	- "help me, I've been enslaved, help me, seek out..."
	- "[[Deities#Erastil]], power, temple, seek out..."

- On the *2nd of Pharast* we met [[Jhod Kavkin]], a monk who claims to be a priest of Erastil
	- says that there's a [[Temple of Elk]] that's long been abandoned southwest in the woods
		- says he would appreciate a report + a holy symbol from the site if possible
		- rumors of healing waters blessed by Erastil there
