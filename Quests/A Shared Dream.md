- the party experienced a shared dream the night of the *28th of Calistril* while sleeping at [[Oleg's Trading Post]]
	- mist settles low around the trading post
	- out of the mist, a voice saying "help, help, help"
	- green hand reaches out and then fades back into the mist

- On the night of the *1st of Pharast*, we had a similar dream
	- a full arm this time, draped in ivy
	- "help me, I've been enslaved, help me, seek out..."
	- "[[Deities#Erastil]], power, temple, seek out..."

- On the *2nd of Pharast* we met [[Jhod Kavkin]], a monk who claims to be a priest of Erastil
	- says that there's a [[Temple of the Elk]] that's long been abandoned southwest in the woods
		- says he would appreciate a report + a holy symbol from the site if possible
		- rumors of healing waters blessed by Erastil there

- The night of the *5th of Pharast*
	- olive-colored face, appears to be in horrible pain
	- "The Guardian of the Bloom", she's being held "deep in [[The Staglord]]'s camp at the banks of the tuskwater"
	- "the staglord - he has captured a portion of my power, and with it, he commands some of my allegiance. However, Erastil's blessing may be able to help you free me"
	- Per Irenna, this may be the same woman that the staglord has been holding captive
		- Irenna has never seen her, only heard her voice
		- The Staglord thinks he and the lady are in love?

- The night of the *7th of Pharast*
	- "The land is being choked. The fog stifles what little is left. Please, if you have the strength, I urge you to stop what the Staglord and his servant druid have been doing. They seem to have somehow corrupted my power. They're turning the land against itself. If you wish to undo their spell upon the land, I urge you to seek out Erastil's blessing. It's the only way that you'll be able to break this spell."
	- "The Temple of the Elk -- an ancient place sotted with Erastil's power. The priest -- the bald one -- he knows the way. He can guide you."

- The *10th of Pharast*
	- went to the Temple of Elk, fought off some corrupted beings, maybe this did something???

- The *13th of Pharast*
	- after fighting the Staglord, we found what is presumed to be a lock of her hair on his person
	- the lock of hair was doing something supernatural that maybe linked to the shadows/zombies that attacked??
		- blown away in the wind right after the battle...
