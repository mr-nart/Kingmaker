- mutilated bodies found in [[New Stetven]], injuries consistent with some kind of ritual?
	- linked to the [[Black Tears]]? have been tailing them as they make their way towards [[Restov]]

## Restov Docks
- found evidence of some kind of trade deal happening on the Restov docks
	- a Black Tears member (Eric) ambushed someone who had just purchased a [[Notable Items#Giant's Mantle]] in order to steal it
		- *Caine killed Eric after extracting information* about some *plot to remove the swordlords (and elves?) from power* in Restov, apparently involving some kinds of *sacrifical rituals* + the item to bring about some magicky whatever
		- *planning to launch some kind of attack at Aldori Manor*

## Aldori Manor
- one very suspicious guest -- *a female halfling named [[Gilda Goodword]] has concealing makeup over her left cheek, covering her face with a hood...*
	- perhaps unlikely to be a Black Tears member? Eric was pretty racist, so unclear if a halfling would be allowed in
	- [[Garrett Goodword]] claims she's his cousin and that he's mentoring her in the family business
- *discussed security issue briefly w/ [[Kesten Garess]] during the party*, will discuss further after
