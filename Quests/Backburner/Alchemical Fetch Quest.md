- [[Old Bokken]] wants us to gather some fangberries for some potions
	- "will pay handsomely" - any 3 potions for free or 25% discount for a month in exchange for a basket
	- "spiders are also fond of fangberries"
- There's also some "big stick lady" who wants fangberries, too + rattlecap mushrooms
	- in exchange for "shinies"

**fangberries**
- collected by Hedera + co., had to fight some spiders to get them
- Hedera took some cuttings to try to propagate the bushes
