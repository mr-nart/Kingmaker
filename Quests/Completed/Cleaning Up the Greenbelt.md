- Our party vs. Lander's/Tartuccio's party to clear the [[Greenbelt]] region of bandits first to win the [[Documents#Exploration Charter]]
- Tartuccio going South along the Shrike, on canoes?
	- Mayor [[Irven]] (Nivakta's Crossing) maybe overheard something about them suspecting the bandits to be based in one of the ruins in the area

## Issues at Oleg's
- We headed to [[Oleg's Trading Post]] to the west, arrived on the *28th of Calistril*
	- [[Oleg Leveton]] is having issues with bandits demanding a monthly tax, under the leadership of [[The Staglord]]?
		- always come within an hour of sunrise on the first day of the month, like clockwork
	- *we are preparing to ambush the collectors* when they arrive on the *1st of Pharast*, will try to capture at least one person to interrogate

>[!info|bg-c-gray] **Intel from Oleg**
> - led by The Staglord?
> - lieutenants bear some kind of medallions?
> 	- image of something like a **wolf's head with stag antlers**
> - named members who have participated in taxing Oleg:
> 	- **Haps** -- male, wields a bow
> 	- **Kressle** -- female, wields hatchets, "she does most of the talking"

#### Tax Day
- **Haps** + 5 low-level bandits showed up
	- 3 killed in battle, Haps + 2 captured
	- Haps is tied to [[Hedera Wildbow|Hedera]]'s backstory, see her page for more details
- Haps and one bandit killed by Hedera, only Rex is left

>[!info|bg-c-gray] **some interrogation**
>- **Kressle** is Haps' lieutenant, reportedly has about a dozen men in her crew
>	- "she'll be coming sooner than later if we aren't back with the goods"
>- other lieutenants?
>	- *Akiros*?
>	- *Ox*?
>	- *Dovan*?
>- **The Staglord**
>	- *really loves booze* (whiskey) -- *we've poisoned some whiskey with some fly agaric, maybe this can work?*
>	- actively recruiting
>	- base is a *fort to the south* on the banks of the Tuskwater(?) -- "just follow the river south, you can't miss it"
>		- has an *old man locked up in the basement*?
>			- "he's an even crazier old bastard than the Staglord"
>	- rumors:
>		- has some kind of mystical powers (controls the fog?)
>		- "he's fucking crazy, he punched a horse for spitting"

#### Kressle + her crew
- Rex agreed to lead us to her camp in exchange for letting him go, but fog rolled in + our party changed tactics to staying here and defending the trading post instead
- *Svetlana has requested that we attempt to recover the wedding band that Kressle stole*
	- gold w/ a pearl setting, engraved with "O + S"
- Kressle and her crew never showed up at the trading post, so on the *3rd of Pharast* the group set out towards her camp, led by Rex
	- made it there @ a fork in the **Thornriver**, let Rex go free
		- he ran North along the game trail
	- Rex had previously mentioned a code phrase used by the bandits: *"By the bloody bones of Saint Gilmorg, who wants to know?"*
		- it changes every so often, though
	- from a distance, can spot Kressle + 13 others
- defeated Kressle's crew, though one escaped. Kressle was apprehended
	- unable to find Svetlana's ring -- maybe was taken by mitflits (fey creatures?) that attacked the bandit camp last week
		- there are small tracks going southeast from the camp, consistent with Kressle's story
	- confiscated their loot, buried it a little ways away from the camp, planning to follow the tracks to find the ring/see what's going on with this fey stuff
	- Hedera is adamant -- Kressle needs to die (for association with the crew that murdered her village)
		- willing to wait "as long as she continues to be helpful"

#### Kobold scouts
- soostcale kobolds willing to scout out the staglord's fort for us?

#### Turncoats
- **KRESSLE (IRENNA) JOINED OUR CREW**???
- others may be willing to become turncoats? namely, **Akiros**, another of the lieutenants

#### The Guardian of the Bloom
- see [[A Shared Dream]]

#### Tuskwater
- we infiltrated the base, we killed the Staglord, now on to collect our settlement charter...
