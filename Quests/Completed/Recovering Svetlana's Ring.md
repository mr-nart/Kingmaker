- [[Svetlana Leveton]] asked us to retrieve her wedding band that was taken by the Greenbelt bandits who were taxing her and [[Oleg Leveton]]
- was missing from Kressle's camp
	- Kressle mentioned a recent raid on the camp by [[Creatures|Mitflits]] riding giant insects, who may or may not have taken the ring

## Mitflit Hollow
- we followed some tracks from the camp up to a sycamore tree with a hollow beneath it
	- on the way there were a bunch of dead mitflits and kobolds -- apparently some kind of ongoing conflict?
- approached by some kobolds about meeting their kobold chief-king?
	- we declined
	- kobolds went into the hollow alone, sounds of screaming
- we entered the hollow
	- fought some mitflits + giant centipedes
	- found a ledger written in Undercommon -- made mention of a ring, stolen from the mitflits by the kobolds (per Mik'mek)
	- we plan to try to trade with the kobolds to get the ring

## Kobold Warrens
- after defeating "[[Tartuccio|Tar'tuk]]" and getting in the good graces of Chief Sootscale & Mik'mek, we recovered Svetlana's ring

- Kressle (actually [[Irenna]]) has joined our group
	- revealed that she's actually Svetlana's sister
	- remorseful about everything she's done

## Oleg's
- Irenna and Svetlana were able to make up
- Svetlana offered Irenna a place at Oleg's
	- Irenna will continue with our party for the time being, at least until we take down the Staglord
