- mutilated bodies found in [[New Stetven]], injuries consistent with some kind of ritual?
	- linked to the [[Black Tears]]? have been tailing them as they make their way towards [[Restov]]

## Restov Docks
- found evidence of some kind of trade deal happening on the Restov docks
	- a Black Tears member (Eric) ambushed someone who had just purchased a [[Notable Items#Giant's Mantle]] in order to steal it
		- *Caine killed Eric after extracting information* about some *plot to remove the swordlords (and elves?) from power* in Restov, apparently involving some kinds of *sacrifical rituals* + the item to bring about some magicky whatever
		- *planning to launch some kind of attack at Aldori Manor*

## Aldori Manor
- one very suspicious guest -- *a female halfling named [[Gilda Goodword]] has concealing makeup over her left cheek, covering her face with a hood...*
	- perhaps unlikely to be a Black Tears member? Eric was pretty racist, so unclear if a halfling would be allowed in
	- [[Garrett Goodword]] claims she's his cousin and that he's mentoring her in the family business
	- Gilda *does not have a forearm tattoo*, not a Black Tears member, but they're hiding something clearly
- *discussed security issue briefly w/ [[Kesten Garess]] during the party*, will discuss further after
	- Caine explained everything he knows, handed over the giant's mantle, discussed Gilda's makeup
	- Caine will stand guard overnight w/ Brenza & Ulfric, who are holding onto his weapons

## Midnight Assault
- they've attacked in the night
- had an ogre and a frost giant working with them??

## [[The Pitaxian Spy]]
- per Jamandi, she received intel regarding a possible link between a Pitaxian spy present among the guests and the Black Tears?? (the spy is clearly [[Tartuccio]]...)
