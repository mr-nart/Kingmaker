## **Equipment**
#### Coyote Cloak
>[!tldr|no-t bg-c-gray collapse]
>This dusty cloak is made of mangy brown-and-gray coyote fur. You gain a +1 item bonus to Survival checks. If you critically succeed at your Survival check to Subsist, you can feed twice as many additional creatures.

#### Gnarled Fey Sticks?
>[!tldr|no-t bg-c-gray collapse]
>A pair of magical sticks recovered from [[Tartuccio]]. One originally belonged to the [[Creatures#Mitflits]] living in [[The Old Sycamore]], and the other was found inside an artifact originally belonging to the [[Creatures#Sootscale Kobolds]] in the [[Kobold Warrens]]. Unclear what their abilities or purposes are, though they appear to have a strong affinity to one another, and supposedly Tartuccio intended to use them for some kind of ritual. Per Queen Ba-dah of the mitflits, the sticks may be the key to unlocking some kind of "chamber where somebody very powerful has stored a treasure."

## **Consumables**
#### Moon Radishes
>[!tldr|no-t bg-c-gray collapse]
>Huge white radishes, apparently highly sought after. [[Old Bokken]] will trade potions in exchange for moon radishes. Some kobolds we met in a forest in the [[Greenbelt]] seem to hold the radishes as sacred, as they bear "powers to heal."

## **Miscellaneous**
#### Leaf Token

>[!tldr|no-t bg-c-gray collapse]
>![[Pasted image 20240914220841.png|right|60]] A strange leaf with a strange etching on it. Found at the abandoned hut (presumably the former home of [[The Staglord]]) outside the [[Temple of Elk]].

These items turned out to not actually be that notable.

### Giant's Mantle
>[!tldr|no-t bg-c-gray collapse]
>Artifact made of cloth, desired by the [[Black Tears]] -- unclear what purpose it serves exactly, but supposedly with additional research, could be used to unlock understanding of Giant magic?
