## **Equipment**
#### Tracker's Goggles
>[!tldr|no-t bg-c-gray collapse]
>These lenses of forest-green glass are bound in rough leather stitched with crude twine. While wearing these goggles, you gain a +1 bonus to Survival checks to [Sense Direction](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=64) and [Track](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=66). If you fail a check to Track, you can try again after 30 minutes rather than an hour.

#### Coyote Cloak
>[!tldr|no-t bg-c-gray collapse]
>This dusty cloak is made of mangy brown-and-gray coyote fur. You gain a +1 item bonus to Survival checks. If you critically succeed at your Survival check to Subsist, you can feed twice as many additional creatures.

## **Consumables**
#### Moon Radishes
>[!tldr|no-t bg-c-gray collapse]
>Huge white radishes, apparently highly sought after. [[Old Bokken]] will trade potions in exchange for moon radishes. Some kobolds we met in a forest in the [[Greenbelt]] seem to hold the radishes as sacred, as they bear "powers to heal."

These items turned out to not actually be that notable.

### Giant's Mantle
>[!tldr|no-t bg-c-gray collapse]
>Artifact made of cloth, desired by the [[Black Tears]] -- unclear what purpose it serves exactly, but supposedly with additional research, could be used to unlock understanding of Giant magic?
