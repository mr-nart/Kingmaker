## **Equipment**
#### Coyote Cloak
>This dusty cloak is made of mangy brown-and-gray coyote fur. You gain a +1 item bonus to Survival checks. If you critically succeed at your Survival check to Subsist, you can feed twice as many additional creatures.

#### Gnarled Fey Sticks
>A pair of magical sticks recovered from [[Tartuccio]]. One originally belonged to the [[Creatures#Mitflits]] living in [[The Old Sycamore]], and the other was found inside an artifact originally belonging to the [[Creatures#Sootscale Kobolds]] in the [[Oak Top Silver Mine]]. Unclear what their abilities or purposes are, though they appear to have a strong affinity to one another, and supposedly Tartuccio intended to use them for some kind of ritual. Per Queen Ba-dah of the mitflits, the sticks may be the key to unlocking some kind of "chamber where somebody very powerful has stored a treasure."

#### Stag's Helm
>This impressive-looking helmet is crafted to resemble the skull of a mighty stag. Although made from bone, the antlers and helm are as strong as iron. *Stag's helms* are the creation of the church of [[Deities#Erastil]], and worshipers of this deity find that the helm is not only particularly comfortable to wear, but that they can activate it once per hour rather than once per day. While worn, it grants a +1 item bonus to Perception checks.  
> >**Activate** free-action ; **Frequency** once per day (or once per hour if the wearer worships Erastil); **Effect** Choose a single creature within 30 feet. The stag's helm focuses your aim and grants supernatural insight into your next shot. Your target is flat-footed to the next ranged Strike you make this turn against them.

## **Consumables**
#### Moon Radishes
>Huge white radishes, apparently highly sought after. [[Old Bokken]] will trade potions in exchange for moon radishes. Some kobolds we met in a forest in the [[Greenbelt]] seem to hold the radishes as sacred, as they bear "powers to heal."

## **Miscellaneous**
#### Leaf Token
>![[leaf token.png|right|60]] A strange leaf with a strange etching on it. Found at the abandoned hut (presumably the former home of [[The Staglord]]) outside the [[Temple of the Elk]].

These items turned out to not actually be that notable.

### Giant's Mantle
>Artifact made of cloth, desired by the [[Black Tears]] -- unclear what purpose it serves exactly, but supposedly with additional research, could be used to unlock understanding of Giant magic?
