## Giant's Mantle
Artifact made of cloth, desired by the [[Black Tears]] -- unclear what purpose it serves exactly, but supposedly with additional research, could be used to unlock understanding of Giant magic?

## Tracker's Goggles
These lenses of forest-green glass are bound in rough leather stitched with crude twine. While wearing these goggles, you gain a +1 bonus to Survival checks to [Sense Direction](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=64) and [Track](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=66). If you fail a check to Track, you can try again after 30 minutes rather than an hour.

## Coyote Cloak
This dusty cloak is made of mangy brown-and-gray coyote fur. You gain a +1 item bonus to Survival checks. If you critically succeed at your Survival check to Subsist, you can feed twice as many additional creatures.
