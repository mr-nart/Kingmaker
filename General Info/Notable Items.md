# **Equipment**
#### Gnarled Fey Sticks
>A pair of magical sticks recovered from [[Tartuccio]]. One originally belonged to the [[Creatures#Mitflits]] living in [[The Old Sycamore]], and the other was found inside an artifact originally belonging to the [[Creatures#Sootscale Kobolds]] in the [[Oak Top Silver Mine]]. Unclear what their abilities or purposes are, though they appear to have a strong affinity to one another, and supposedly Tartuccio intended to use them for some kind of ritual. Per Queen Ba-dah of the mitflits, the sticks may be the key to unlocking some kind of "chamber where somebody very powerful has stored a treasure."

#### Moon Radishes
>Huge white radishes, apparently highly sought after. [[Old Bokken]] will trade potions in exchange for moon radishes. Some kobolds we met in a forest in the [[Greenbelt]] seem to hold the radishes as sacred, as they bear "powers to heal."

# **Miscellaneous**
#### Leaf Token
>![[leaf token.png|right|60]] A strange leaf with a strange etching on it. Found at the abandoned hut (presumably the former home of [[The Staglord]]) outside the [[Temple of the Elk]].

These items turned out to not actually be that notable.

### Giant's Mantle
>Artifact made of cloth, desired by the [[Black Tears]] -- unclear what purpose it serves exactly, but supposedly with additional research, could be used to unlock understanding of Giant magic?
