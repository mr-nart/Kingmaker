## Exploration Charter
"Be it known that the bearer of this charter has been charged by the [[Aldori Swordlords|Swordlords]] of Restov, acting upon the greater good and authority vested within them by the office of [[Ioseph Sellemius|the Lord-Mayor of Restov]], the right of exploration and travel within the wilderness regions known as [[Restov]]'s Hinterlands and the [[Greenbelt]].

Exploration should be limited to an area west and south of [[Oleg's Trading Post]], no further than the banks of the Shrike and Skunk Rivers. The carrier of this charter should strive against banditry and other unlawful behavior to be encountered. The Punishment for unrepentant banditry remains, as always, execution by sword or rope.

So witnessed on this 24th day of Calistril, under watchful eye of the Lordship of Restov."
