## Mitflits
**Mitflits** are fey creatures.

## Sootscale Kobolds
The **sootscale kobolds** are a group of charcoal-colored kobolds living in the [[Kobold Warrens|remnants of the Oak Top Silver Mine]], led by Chief Sootscale. Their mythology includes the worship of a winged hero named Old Sharp Tooth, though recent events involving a false prophet named [[Tartuk]] may have sullied that traditional faith.

Other notable members include Mikmek, a pleasant kobold our party saved from the mitflits living under a nearby Sycamore Tree.
