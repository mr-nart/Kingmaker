## Mitflits
**Mitflits** (or "mites") are fey beings, described as short, grotesque, blue-skinned creatures. The party has encountered one group of them living in [[The Old Sycamore]] in the Greenbelt, led by Queen Ba-dah.

Of note, this group was in possession of one of the [[Notable Items#Gnarled Fey Sticks?]] with the stated purpose of keeping it safe. It is unknown who bestowed this responsibility on the mitflits.

## Sootscale Kobolds
The **sootscale kobolds** are a group of charcoal-colored kobolds living in the [[Kobold Warrens|remnants of the Oak Top Silver Mine]], led by Chief Sootscale. Their mythology includes the worship of a winged hero named Old Sharp Tooth, though recent events involving a false prophet named [[Tartuccio|Tartuk]] may have sullied that traditional faith.

Other notable members include Mikmek, a pleasant kobold our party saved from the mitflits living under a nearby Sycamore Tree, and Nakpik, who accompanied us to broker a truce with the mitflits.
