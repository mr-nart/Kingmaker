>The [[Greenbelt]] is a swath of land in the northern part of the [[Stolen Lands]]. 

## Dangers
Outside of the region's [[Greenbelt Bandits|bandits]], this area is home to *kobolds*, *goblins*, the *undead*, and "*half-men that will nibble at your fucking shins*." Of note, it is said that the woods hold greater perils than the open terrain, with particular reference to "*plants that will come alive and eat you*."

## The Fog
A dense fog rolls in on occasion, typically lasting one to two days at a time. Rumors attribute its presence to [[The Staglord]].
