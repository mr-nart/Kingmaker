>Brevoy is a proud land, known throughout Golarion for producing able warriors, regal nobles, and clever rogues. Yet Brevoy’s two regions, Issia and Rostland, have long held one another in contempt and now stand on the verge of civil war. Both Issia and Rostland were independent nations until [[Choral the Conqueror]]’s barbarian armies and red dragon servitors united the regions into a single kingdom two centuries ago. Until recently, the iron rule of [[Brevic Noble Houses#House Rogarvia|House Rogarvia]] maintained a fragile peace between the two regions. But a decade ago, the ruling house mysteriously disappeared, and the conniving leaders of Issia’s [[Brevic Noble Houses#House Surtova|House Surtova]] supplanted them as Brevoy’s rulers. Now a labyrinthine political landscape plagues the nation, full of secret alliances, provincial loyalties, and nefarious plots; civil war seems inevitable. In Rostland to the south, the swordlords see in many of Issia’s recent political moves the swift approach of such a war. They rightly fear such an event, for Rostland is smaller than Issia, it has fewer armies, and its rolling hills and grasslands offer very little in the way of natural defenses. Worse, unlike Issia, whose northern border stretches along the Lake of Mists and Veils, which offers some defense, Rostland’s southern border lies along [[Stolen Lands|a stretch of wilderness infested with bandits and monsters]]. If Brevoy falls into civil war, it won’t be long at all before the violent, opportunistic vultures to the south move to take advantage of Rostland’s problems.

## Issia
Pirate nation, northern half of Brevoy. Has an unforgiving geography (little vegetation and poor soil) that forced its people to be cunning and brutal in order to survive, though now many Issians are simple fisherman or traders.

## Rostland
Fertile region, southern half of Brevoy. Known for its master swordsmen and proud, defiant citizenry. Stands on the verge of civil war with Issia, which was gained political control of the region since the disappearance of Brevoy's ruling [[Brevic Noble Houses#House Rogarvia|House Rogarvia]] in 4699 AR.
