>Brambles give way to a clearing, at the center of which sits a looming rock carved into the face of an elk. Stone steps lead up to a temple dedicated to [[Deities#Erastil]] deep in the Narlmarch Woods.

>When our party first arrived, corruption had spread throughout the area, warping the fauna into monstrous aberrations. [[014 - The Corrupted Temple|Upon laying to rest the temple's cursed guardian]], the natural order seems to have returned. 

## Healing Waters
At the foot of the steps of the temple is a large pool of crystal-clear water. Drinking this water is seems to fill one with a deep sense of divine warmth, healing their wounds (to a limited extent).

## Pedestals
Five pedestals sit at the top of the steps. Reportedly, each once held a blessed artifact. Most were probably taken by [[The Staglord]].
