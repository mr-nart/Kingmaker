#brevoy #rostland 

>**Nivakta's Crossing** is the southernmost village of [[Brevoy#Rostland]], situated about a day's travel west of [[Restov]]. The settlement is small, with only a few hundred villagers. Locals are suspicious of travelers, especially those coming from the south.

## Nivakta's Inn
A small inn with a bar.

## Bridge
There is a fortified crossing over the *Shrike River*.

## Crooked Falls
A day's travel to the west of the settlement lies the *Crooked Falls*, a series of waterfalls about 10 to 30 feet in height which spans approximately a mile in length. They empty into the *Shrike River*. Of note, bandits tend to hide along the road in this area to ambush unsuspecting travelers.
