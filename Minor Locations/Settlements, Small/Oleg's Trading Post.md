>**Oleg's Trading Post** serves primarily as a stop for travelers, typically on their way to and from [[Restov]]. The small settlement is surrounded by 10-foot high palisades, with watch towers at each corner which brandish catapults. It is run by [[Oleg]] and his wife [[Svetlana]]. Of note, there have recently been issues with bandits demanding a monthly tax on behalf of their leader, [[The Staglord]].
