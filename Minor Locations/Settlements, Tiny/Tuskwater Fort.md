>North of the Tuskwater is a small wooden fort. It's reported to have been an old keep that predates the bandits, led by [[The Staglord]], who reclaimed it afterwards. There were rumors that the building was once a hub of supernatural activity.

## Zombies and Shadows
Following our party's takedown of the Staglord and his crew, there was a sudden ambush on the encampment by zombies led by a shadow bearing the symbol of [[Deities#Gyronna]]. The significance of this is still unclear.

## Writing on the Walls
Worn down writing in old Taldane describe monks who, acting as servants to [[Deities#Gyronna]], once lived in the area. However, their faith was "not sufficient for their obligations." Additionally, there is a message written in blood: "My God, she's taken all of us. I'm the last one, and I'm next."

## Basement
Beneath the building is a damp cellar, thick with cobwebs. Locked behind a door once resided Nugrah, the captive, crazed father of the Staglord.
