>[!quote] The Free City of Restov

#brevoy #rostland
>**Restov** is a trade and cultural center in [[Brevoy#Rostland]] that sits along the *Shrike River*, which borders the [[Stolen Lands]]. As the birthplace of the Aldori dueling style, the city boasts several dueling schools, which has led the city being a favored place for young nobles to practice. Fights are common.

## Districts
The heart of town is *The Red Table Square (15)*. At its center is a platform where duels are often held.

On the west side of the city are slums known collectively as the *Dwarven District (18)*, though there are few dwarves that actually live in the area.

The *Market District (16)* is nearby, with various shops and outdoor stalls lining the streets.

*The Aldori Wheel (3)* sits on the other side of the city. Legend has it that this landmark is the location where [[Historical Figures#Baron Sirian Aldori]] defeated the ruling bandit lord to take control of the region. Around this site are shops which are more boutique and artisanal in comparison to those in the Market District.

Just north of the docks is the *Upscale District (28)*. The city's wealthy class lives here.

Situated in the docks is the *Riverside District (26)*, home to a variety of minor dueling schools.

## Temples
- *The Temple of Erastil (2)*
- *The Temple of Abadar (6)* is a large, grand building ornately decorated in white and gold. Much of the building is dedicated to business and commerce. A small chapel is located in the building's rear.
- *Sarenrae's Almshouse (20)*
- *Cayden's Keg* is an alehouse that also serves as the city's "place of worship" to [[Deities#Cayden Cailean]]. Led by **Gilford Forhopple**.

## Inns / Taverns
- *Ludavenko's Assembly Palace (12)* is a tavern that serves a high-end clientele. It's known for its VIP section.
- *The Bear and Pitch Inn* is a rustic dining hall on the outskirts of the city.
- *The Silver Moon Inn (17)* is a small inn. Standard affair, nothing particular of note.
- *The Smokehouse (19)* is an inn which is largely visited by Dwarves. A smoky aroma fills the air inside.
- *Oppen's Common House (23)* is a halfling-run in. Unsurprisingly, its ceilings are only 4 feet high. Lodging here is cheap due to the smaller accommodations.
