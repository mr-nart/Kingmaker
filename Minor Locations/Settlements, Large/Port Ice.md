#brevoy #issia 

>**Port Ice**, on the southern bank of the *Lake of Mists and Veils* in northern [[Brevoy]], is a refuge for ruffians and lake pirates. It was formerly the capital of [[Brevoy#Issia]] prior to [[Historical Figures#Choral the Conqueror]] uniting the region.
>
>The port is often overcome by ice and snow in the winter months and sits closed, only visited occasionally until the spring's thaw. The summer months are spent frantically stockpiling supplies for the next winter.
