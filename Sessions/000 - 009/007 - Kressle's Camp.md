## Summary
We fought Kressle and her crew -- Kressle was apprehended, but one of the crew was able to run off during the battle. We were unable to find Svetlana's ring, thought Kressle mentioned that there were some fey creatures ("mitflits") that attacked the camp and were able to make off with some loot last week. We buried some of the bandits' loot that we confiscated with the intention to return to it when we can. Planning to return to the bandit camp to start tracking the small footprints we spotted on the southeast edge.

## Log
#### 3rd of Pharast
- we left off just having spotted Kressle's camp, they don't seem to have noticed us yet
	- looks like they're kinda just milling about
- some kind of structures built into trees?
- wagon on the other side of camp, no one is directly guarding it right now
- now they spotted us, we're gonna have to fight lol
	- Kressle knocked unconscious by Caine
	- defeated the bandits
	- **ONE OF THEM RAN**
- post-battle
	- Kressle in manacles -- 8 gp + 5 sp, amulet, 2 masterwork hatchets (worth x2 sell value), lesser healing potion
	- 6 sp + 10 cp in loot among the bandits collectively, + amulets on each of them
	- the wagon -- empty, booby trapped
	- watch towers -- 2 lesser thunderstones (explodes, deals sonic damage, possibly deafened, requires Fort save)
	- crates underneath tent -- 3 crates full of frozen(?) pelts, 8 bottles of herbal liquor
		- treasure box -- wooden music box, silver earings, 9 gp + 121 sp
	- fixed the broken (and booby-trapped) cart -- can try to take more stuff with us?
- **Kressle's interrogation**
	- ring last seen 3 days ago, stashed under the tents with the treasure box
		- no visitors in last 3 days?
		- last week had weird, half-height, emaciated "i-don't-know-whats"
			- came into the camp, had to fight them off, they rifled through their things
			- they went southeast???
			- blue-white skin, big ears, covered in warts, smell terrible, jagged little knives
				- doesn't sound like any kind of creature that is of the natural world...
				- maybe sound like gremlins of some sort? some kind of fey creature
					- per Liosa, might be "mitflits," also called "mites"?
					- *notably, we haven't really heard about any fey happenings in the Stolen Lands up until now*
			- one of them "rode a fucking bug"
				- not a flying bug, six legs
				- found some old tracks of tiny feet going towards the southeast, might be enough to follow
- Hedera is adamant that Kressle dies (reminder that the Staglord's crew appears to be linked to the murder of her village)
	- is willing to wait "as long as she continues being helpful"

#### 4th of Pharast
- 35F, slight breeze
- night was uneventful, no notable dreams
- we healed up in the morning
- buried the confiscated bandit loot, Garrett marked a tree with a small X to help us find it later
- planning to go back to Kressle's camp to start following the tiny footprints
