## Summary
The tax-collecting [[Greenbelt Bandits]] were defeated/detained at [[Oleg's Trading Post]]. That group's minor leader, *Happs*, was interrogated for information -- he also was the impetus for [[Hedera Wildbow|Hedera]] sharing some of her tragic backstory. The connection shared between the two individuals led to a violent, graphic display of revenge, which *may have started a rift among the party's members*. We are *anticipating retaliation on the trading post* by the bandit lieutenant *Kressle*. We have set alarm snares and repaired one of the nonfunctioning catapults in preparation, and notably, the patch of lantern oil outside Oleg's gates has yet to be ignited. Following this combat, the party intends to release *Rex*, the remaining survivor of the bandit taxers. A fog has begun to settle in. Our shared dream from the previous night was discussed briefly.

## Log
- Claptrap -- that's oleg's horse apparently lol
- We wake up at dawn of the **1st of Pharast** -- it's brisk and cloudy
- sounds of horses...

#### Bandits arrive
- "Happs", male, green cloak, crappy/thin goatee, scars on face, appears to be leader
	  - they've heard of Lander?
	  - oleg has "no love for aldori nobles"
- 5? others w/ hodge podge leather + various weapons
- killed 3, captured 3, brought them to the stable
- Happs' belongings
	- silver amulet w/ medallion, bearing something like a wolf's head with stag antlers
	- composite short bow
	- dagger
	- leather armor
	- crudely written note
	  - "Happs, bring the stuff back. Make sure to grab any booze. We're running low on booze. -K"
- other guys
	- short bow, 4 silver pieces, silver amulet 

#### Jarrin leaves
- "I've heard there's a baron's title for whoever wins the charter for the Greenbelt"
- "I'm rooting for you"

#### Interrogation
- Happs recognizes Hedera????? she recognizes him back...
	- reportedly the most useless ne'er-do-well in Glenwine, always responsible for trouble in town
	- "everybody that we knew was burnt to a crisp"
		- Hedera: "where were you that day?"
			- "no there that day.... off hunting in the woods and came back to the carnage"
	- Hedera: "why are you working for him?"
		- "a man's gotta eat..."
- Hedera seems to recognize the medallion
	- "i can't believe you would work with the people who destroyed our village"
- **Kressle** is Happs' leader (she's one of the lieutenants, at a camp out in the woods)
	- "she'll be coming sooner than later if we aren't back with the goods"
		- "how many does she have with her?"
			- "last I checked, about a dozen men, but I'm sure she could get more"
	- "she's a better shot than me, wicked good with a handaxe, has a mean streak"
- **The Staglord**
	- came to prominence a couple of years ago, ravaging settlements
	- settled down in the Greenbelt
	- lots of rumors about him, particularly that he has some mystical power, that he's "chosen", that *he really loves booze*(?), "wicked shot with a longbow," "he punched a horse for spitting"
	- how many people?
		- he's been recruiting like crazy, guesstimate was ~dozens of men
		- "i can't even keep track of all of them"
	- where's his base?
		- it's a fort to the south... just follow the river south, you can't miss it
		- on the banks of the Tuskwater(?)
		- "i don't think we have any battlements set up"
	- wicked powers?
		- "haven't you seen the fog?"
			- fog that hangs over the greenbelt, comes and goes, apparently at his beckoning
	- face?
		- "ugly bastard"
	- likes Whiskey
- **Old man locked up in the basement of the fort**?
	- "even crazier old bastard than the Staglord"
- **Akiros**?
	- "fucking wicked swordsman"
- **Auchs**?
- **Dovan**?
- About the Greenbelt
	- avoid the kobolds, goblins, undead
	- "woods are scarier than the open terrain"
	- plants that come alive and will eat you?
	- "half-men that will nibble at your fucking shins"?
		- "like old men, wear rags, eat shit, smell worse"

#### Hedera got some baggage
- murdered one of the bandits in cold blood to "motivate" Happs
- she dragged Happs out to the front, hung him by manacles, carved "Glenwine remembers" into his chest
	- executed Happs with an arrow to the head
- everyone is pretty disturbed with what's happened...
	- we need to discuss...

#### last bandit (Rex)
- he'll lead us to Kressle in exchange for letting him fuck off before we engage in combat
- change in plans, we're holding down the fort at the trading post
	- he says they'll come from the southwest

#### fog?
- rolled in during the afternoon, rapidly decreasing visibility
- Oleg says the fog usually lasts about 1-2 days...
- **the party briefly discussed the fact that they all had the same dream...**
- Rex seems to think that he could navigate through the fog
- seems like a safer bet to fortify the fort and wait for Kressle + her men to come to us...

#### [[Glenwine]]
- Hedera had a husband and 3 kids...
- the only thing she ever found out about the massacre was that the assailants had a medallion bearing some kind of animal...
	- today was the only day she's ever found any kind of lead on the perpetrators
- we discussed some ethical concerns
	- ultimately landed on -- **bandits are bandits, the law says bandits are to be punished by hanging or by sword, but torture/carving messages into people's bodies is not OK, and executing prisoners needs to be discussed among the whole party**

#### Svetlana's request
- Kressle took her wedding band -- gold w/ a pearl setting, engraved with "O + S"

#### Plan
- defend the trading post
- alarm snares set up to the southwest, other noisy stuff (broken ceramics) around the trading post
- southeast catapult has been repaired
	- requires 2 people to operate, minimum distance of 50 ft, will have archie and amiri (at minimum) man them
