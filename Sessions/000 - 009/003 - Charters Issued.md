## Summary
The [[Black Tears]]' assault has concluded with the defeat of their apparent leader. Lady [[Jamandi Aldori]] has issued [[Documents#Exploration Charter|exploration charters]] to the guests. However, she notes that a Pitaxian spy has infiltrated the group and is perhaps in cahoots with the attacking gang. [[Tartuccio]] framed [[Caidaranel Novori|Caine]] by planting a ring which bears the seal of [[Pitax]]. Jamandi has decided that the two will be split into opposing parties which will compete to secure the [[Greenbelt]] region in order to be awarded the charter.

## Log
#### first hallway on the way to the west wing
- fire and smoke from side rooms, only 5 ft visibility
	- put on wet cloths over mouths, but still choking us...
	- we're extinguishing fires, got some of them, Linzi asking people in the main hall to help finish the job
- shrine to Milani?
	- a sense of safety emanating from a statue
	- faint whisper in elven "thank you child, please protect my follower"
	- we stood there for a minute, gave us effects of a long rest

#### gallery at the end of the hallway
- Tartuccio is in here on the ground, but he's conscious, Caine walked him back to the main hall as he said his belongings have all been taken from him (meaning he can't help us lmao)
	- gave Caine a very fine but gaudy gold ring, "maybe it will protect you" (ring of protection +1)
		- Caine said he would return it, but Tartuccio said "nah it's yours bro"

#### door to the north
- brass ear: muffled speaking and then a clear "shut up, elf"
- Jaethal was inside, gagged and bound, with some black tears dudes
	- defeated them, one guy is unconscious rather than dead
	- Nishkiv the Knife -- apparently a miniboss, he died like immediately lmao
- there's a trophy hall, leads to the dueling hall
- Jaethal has joined us

#### dueling hall
- just a huge ton of carnage...
- Jamandi aldori vs 2 frost giants
- a bunch of black tears guys enter from the south
	- Jamandi says "just in time, take out their leader, she's with them, i'll take care of these oafs"
	- Volodmyra (leader presumably) -- crooked scar on chin, missing piece of left ear, wearing long black coak, curved greataxe
		- death by Garrett 
		- magical goggles? *Tracker's goggles*, +1 to survival to track people
		- enchanted greataxe? *+1 greataxe*
		- jade and pearl necklace and silver ring, just worth some gold (20 and 30 respectively)
- we killed the rest of the black tears guys + helped with one of the giants
	- Lady Jamandi did some anime shit for the finishing blow lol

#### back to the main hall, after putting out the remaining fires, treating the wounded
- engineers have arrived to assess damage/perform repairs
- people are preparing funeral services, cleaning things up
- "very few signs of the violence remain"
- "there are far fewer heroes here than the previous night"
- issuing formal charters this morning
	- one to the Iron Wraiths -- Glenebon Uplands, will need to deal with the [[Tiger Lords]]
	- one to Baron Hannis Drelev -- at Hoke Tunge Sloh
	- one to Maegar Varn -- at Nomen Heights
		- Aldori Swordlords plan to eventually establish a dueling school there
	- one for all of the adventurers here from last night?
- spy from Pitax???
	- Tartuccio? accuses Caine who is wearing his ring which bears the seal of Pitax
	- Lander is a dumbass and suggested that both Tartuccio and Caine go with charters
		- Caine suggested that neither go...
	- Jamandi's final decision was that we both go in opposing, competing parties to the Green Belt to see who defeats the bandit lords in the area there first???
		- insisted that it's better that the spy participate so they can "keep an eye on them"
		- bro these guys are idiots...
- *Our party* is going w/ a provisioner + some other hirelings provided by Lady Jamandi
- Lady Aldori rewards 50 gp and 2 lesser healing potions each
- Kesten offers a cloak found in the Scullery which "he believes is magical"
	- *Coyote Cloak* - +1 to survival, can feed twice as many creatures when rolling to subsist
	- plus some other random loot
- Caine takes off the ring and wordlessly drops it at the ground at Tartuccio's feet
