## Summary
We continued making preparations for defending the trading post. The group met [[Old Bokken]], who has requested moon radishes in exchange for potions. Overnight our shared dream picked up a few new details, the voice now speaking the words "Erastil, power, temple, seek out". The fog lifted, but because Kressle and her crew never showed up, on the *3rd of Pharast* we set out for their camp. On the way, Garrett talked some kobolds into letting us have some of their moon radishes. When Rex led us safely to the bandit camp at a fork in the *Thornriver*, we let him go. From the distance we can spot Kressle + 13 others. We need a plan... Rex did mention a code phrase: "By the bloody bones of Saint Gilmorg, who wants to know?"
