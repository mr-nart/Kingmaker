## Summary
We journeyed from [[Restov]] to [[Oleg's Trading Post]] (with the help of Jarun, a provisioner, and a contingent of 4 guards) without any issues. At the trading post, [[Oleg|Oleg]] and [[Svetlana|Svetlana]] informed us of their issues with bandits demanding a monthly tax, apparently under the leadership of an individual known as "[[The Staglord]]." We are intending to ambush the collectors when they arrive at dawn (on the *1st of Pharast*). During the night, the party had a shared dream, though they have yet to discuss it with each other.

## Log
- Opal (one of Lady Aldori's people) comes to introduce us
	- says we're not just racing against the other group, but also the "awareness of the Surtovas"
- Jarun (provisioner) has enough to get to Oleg's to resupply + a contingent of 4 guards
	- with us mostly to make sure we can get to Oleg's, ~4 days of travel per Jarun
- Tartuccio's group will travel the same road as us until Crooked falls, then will go south along the Shrike River
- **re: bandits**
	- per Garrett, rumors about profound cruelty & they go by some animal name
	- per Linzi, even the Pitaxians are scared of them
- **other possible political players?**
	- Greenbelt has the best farming land in the Stolen Lands
	- other groups with some interest -- Pitax, Galt, 7 arches, nearby dwarves
- **re: Pitax-Brevoy rivalry?** King Castruccio Irovetti came to power a few years ago
	- => there's now some uncertainty between the 2 countries

#### Day 1 of travel
- overcast and windy, doesn't seem like it'll rain, though
- journey from Restov to Nivakta's Crossing is pretty uneventful, arrive around the end of the day
	- it's the southernmost village in Rostland, maybe only a couple hundred villagers
	- "the people there are friendly but they're definitely a suspicious lot in general"
		- "they trust us more than they would travelers from the South"
	- a very fortified crossing that bridges over the Shrike River
	- will stay at Nivakta's Inn
- **reintroductions**
	- Jarun -- one of Lady Jamandi's quartermasters, brings goods to Oleg's about 1-2x per month
		- mule's name is Dora
	- Garrett -- merchant, coming along with Gilda, was wanting to meet Oleg to establish business relations
	- Amiri -- "famous for this sword, got it from killing a giant"
	- Celestine -- devout follower of Sarenrae, going on behalf of the almshouse, wants to set up somewhere for the poor and needy
	- Liosa -- formerly apprentice to a castlemage in the capitol, lately working as a magic consultant in Restov
	- Archie -- smith, good friend of Kesten, requested personally by him
	- Linzi -- here to chronicle journeys of the heroes who reclaim the stolen lands, trained in the arts
	- Hedera -- "not much of a talker, excellent hunter, going to hunt, other than that, my reasons are my own"
- **Nivakta's mayor [[Irven Revanisu]] greets us**, is looking forward to us defeating some bandits
	- sounds like all the groups passed through here
	- Tartuccio said they were gonna use canoes to travel, something about a set of ruins where he thinks the bandits are hiding
		- "there are a lot of ruins in the Stolen Lands"
	- Linzi talks about a tower in the lake?
- guy wearing a green cloak at the bar, seems to be the focus of attention?
	- he seems to be boastful, has on his belt a very large bastard sword (named "yellow belly" because "it either makes them pee or I cut them in the belly")
	- saying some nonsense about trouncing bandits that tried to come into town a while ago
	- it's "Master Kavin", the local sheriff, mostly scares people off, can't really help
	- apparently lost a sparring match against lord Maegar Varn
	- any strangers passing through?
		- merchant caravan from Cheliax? had really big crates, was about a week or two ago, just passed through
		- some kobolds?

#### Day 2
- awaken to Jarun's knocks and the sound of light rain
- road winds to the west
- Crooked Falls -- a series of about 10-30 ft waterfalls about a mile long, tributary into the Shrike river
	- Jarun's heard rumors of bandits hidden in this particular area, blind spots along the road
		- but we do see some blood stains (looks fresh, maybe 8 hours ago) and some hastily dug mounds
- where did they get canoes?
	- an old fort where Lady Aldori ran some operations out of a wihle ago, Fort Sorrenco? a little south on the river
- made camp at a clearing where Jarun usually stops, Jarun set up some tents
- Amiri leaves camp saying she's going to get something fresher
	- comes back with a wild pig
- Celestine and Caine foraged some mushrooms
- Caine has been healing people up, got everyone up to full over the course of the last two days
- watch order: Amiri + Caine, Garrett, Hedera + Celestine

#### Day 3
- pretty cold (40 F), no rain/snow though
- as we go up the road NW, we see some crudely constructed gallows on the side of the road?
	- two corpses hanging, nailed fabric on them saying "death to all bandits"
	- we clean them up, bury them
- a crudely constructed hut to the south?
	- herbalist named "[[Old Bocken]]"? usually seen at Oleg's
- we push on into the evening to get a little farther
- watch order: Amiri + Caine, Garrett, Hedera + Celestine

#### Day 4 (28th of Calistril)
- clear day, windy
- make it to Oleg's by midday
	- rather large encampment, 10-ft high palisade, watch towers at each corner w/ catapults (not functional right now)
- someone is yelling across the courtyard as we approach?
	- voices grow quiet, someone pokes their head out of the gate, young woman w/ blond hair (Svetlana Leviton)?
- Svetlana welcomes us through the gate
	- she's Oleg's wife
- tomorrow's the monthly tax collection?
- Svetlana brings us inside

>[!tldr|bg-c-gray]- Garrett hangs back to talk to Oleg
> - they have some kind of mutual contact
> - he delivered Mayra (Gilda) to Oleg, smuggled from Cheliax
> - Oleg was expecting supplies alongside her, but Garrett didn't have any to bring?

- Svetlana feeds us stew and red wine (Wiscranny Barbara)
	- just the couple here right now
	- Old Bocken comes from time to time
	- "we had others before"
- enough bunks for the 8 main people, Lady Jamandi's people have to set up camp outside
- **re: bandits**
	- they've been getting bolder lately? 
	- lieutenants have medallions?
	- *The Staglord* and his crew
		- "I hear he's maybe a goat demon... a goat demon... a stag demon i guess?"
		- he's been training them in combat
	- bandits threatening arson unless they give all their supplies
	- always come within an hour of sunrise on the first day of the month, like clockwork, usually with a wagon
		- man armed w/ bow (Haps?), woman w/ hatchets (Crestle, she does most of the talking)
		- one visit, there were 10 people
		- last visit, came only with 4 men
- **Celestine's idea**
	- pay the tax, poke a hole in a bag of rice, follow the trail?
- **Hedera's idea**
	- lantern oil spread on the ground, set it ablaze when they come, ambush
	- this is the one we're going with, will try to capture someone if we can for information
- Archie has started making repairs on the catapults, should take a few days

#### A shared dream??
- mist, settles low around the trading post
- out of the mist, a voice saying "help, help, help"
- green hand reaches out and fades back into the mist
