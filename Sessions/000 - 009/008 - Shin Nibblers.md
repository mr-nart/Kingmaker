## Summary
The party crossed overland from Kressle's camp following the mitflit tracks, crossing a rickety bridge. We saw a variety of mitflit bodies in varying states of decay, then saw kobold bodies. We found a large sycamore tree with a hollow beneath it. The party was leaving when a squad of kobolds asked for them to meet the kobold chief-king, but the party declined, so the kobolds bravely delved into the tree on their own… and screamed. The party decided to go down after all, hoping Svetlana’s ring was there. We smashed through some mitflits and giant centipedes, and the story will resume with the party about to face off against a mite riding a giant tick. Amiri and Linzi are watching Kressle outside the hollow.
