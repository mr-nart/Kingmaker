## Summary
Managed to defeat Grabble and Tickleback. In Grabble's possessions, he had a statue with a magical aura bound to a chunk of mithril that seemed to be able to reanimate a nearby corpse. The party proceeded farther into the tunnels below the old sycamore tree. Encountered giant whiptail centipedes. Saved a lone surviving kobold tied up -- Mik'mek. They had been looking for the statue, which is an object of worship for the Kobolds -- it was an artifact of Old Sharp Tooth, the winged hero of the sootscale kobolds. We surfaced and are travelling south toward the Kobold Warrens. Of note, there has been a purple-scaled kobold named Tar'tuk who has risen to power.
