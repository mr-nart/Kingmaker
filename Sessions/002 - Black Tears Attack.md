## Summary
The [[Black Tears]] launched an organize assault during the night -- lots of guards have died, as well as Ivenzi (who is that? lol). So far we've confirmed the survival of [[Linzi]], [[Amiri]], [[Harrim]], [[Valerie]], and [[Kesten Garess|Kesten]]. Kesten intends to hold down the main hall and has asked us to give aid to Lady [[Jamandi Aldori|Jamandi]] in the dueling hall, located in the manor's west wing.

## Log
- Caine on guard w/ Ulfric & Brenza on East side
	- hissing sound from a smoking bush outside?? -- some kind of sphere emanating smoke
	- it was a weird ass smoke bomb
- Black Tears attack, portcullises dropped
	- ah shit ulfric and brenza died
	- Caine knocked one out, manacled them

#### Between combats
- Celestine is upstairs, missed the combat, makes her way downstairs
- make our way towards West side, there's still some sounds of fighting
- lots of dead guards... other guests' rooms empty, evidence of combat

#### Combat in water garden
- 4 dudes, we beat them

#### In a hallway
- sounds of grunting and roaring from a room to the north
- some side rooms, a lot of dead bodies, lots of belongings appear picked through

#### The aforementioned room
- it's a library, there's a bunch of dead guards
- Linzi in here engaged in combat w/ a blind(?) ogre named Gromog
	- we killed him (Archie decapitated him)
- Linzi said everything all happened so fast, has joined us for now

#### Scullery hall
- blue-skinned humanoid, 10 ft tall (frost giant) screaming bloody murder @ the other side of the room
	- surrounded by A LOT OF CORPSES
- we closed the door lol
- okay we opened it back up, he looks extremely wounded? particularly his left arm which looks basically unusable
	- he took down Celestine, Caine healed her back up
	- Hedera shot him to death
- **Ivenzi (one of the adventurers??) is now dead**
- **Amiri, Harrim, Valerie around the corner, unconscious, tied up**
	- we pulled them into the main hall
- sounds of combat have given away to just some talking

#### Double doors -> Main banquet hall
- doors were barricaded, Garrett called through the doors, they unbarricaded them
- made it to the main banquet hall
- Kesten is here, Lady Jamandi locked in one of the other rooms, she dropped the failsafe to drop the portcullises
	- she took a squad of 8 guards with her to take back the dueling hall in the west wing
	- Kesten will stay to hold the main hall, he's asking us to go help Lady Jamandi
