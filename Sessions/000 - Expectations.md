## Summary
Finalized(?) characters, set campaign expectations. Did some individual RP to get us all to Aldori Manor. Caine learned vague information of the [[Black Tears]]' plot to remove the swordlords (and elves?) from Rostland in the name of Issia. Next up is finding a way into the Aldori party and/or alerting them of what may transpire.

## Log
- broad campaign, not super comedic, lots of drama & austere environments
- bad guys aren't just waiting for us to do stuff -- they will keep doing stuff if we're dicking around lol
- feel free to jump in to narrate your actions
- *please try to make characters that will work together*
	- Jess will run pvp if needed, but please don't lol
- *there may be scenes related to violence against women and children / depictions of torture / child abuse / neglect / substance abuse*
	- depictions will not be too graphic -- please speak up if uncomfortable
	- *will NOT allow sexual violence or intimate scenes* -- if they happen, will be a "fade to black"
	- "will probably be around an R-rated movie"

#### Sessions
- meet *twice a month as a goal*, will try to pencil in for *evenings*, generally friday nights
- cancellations will happen probably if over 2 players absent (or the GM lol)
- goal of *5 hours/session*

#### Scene setting
- we're all headed to Restov, the last major outpost of civilization on the southern edge of Brevoy
	- lots of backstory about [[Brevoy]], see the dedicated page for the history lesson lol
	- the Aldori Swordlords have been scheming in the background to try to take back Rostland
