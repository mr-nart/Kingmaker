## Summary
We spent a bunch of time discussing our future barony, which we will name [[Verdanti]]. Made our way back to Restov. Will have a meeting with Lady [[Minerva Lebeda]], one of Lady Aldori's "trusted proxies." In the meantime, we are finding things to do. Caine and Liosa are at the [[Restov#Birchwood Hall]] to peruse records of prior expeditions in the Greenbelt, mainly looking for information regarding the undead threats in the region. Garrett was looking for information about the Bellflower Network, only to be contacted first. The session ended early.

**23rd of Pharast, Fireday**
- approaching Restov with Kesten by midday
- we hear word that the other groups have also been successful, but we're the first group to make it back to Restov
- this evening, there's a meeting with one of Lady Aldori's "trusted proxies"
	- with Lady [[Minerva Lebeda]], cousin of Lander
		- Celestine's general impression of her: not in direct line of succession, sympathies that lie more along with those of Rostland, very capable, not always the most kind-hearted person, she hates Lander
- *records about previous expeditions to the Greenbelt?* Kesten suggests:
	- could ask someone who participated in the past (i.e. Lady Aldori)
	- could see if there are records with the local branch of the Pathfinder Society
		- The [[Restov#Birchwood Hall]] -- largely in disuse due to some politics, the schedule is pretty sporadic per Liosa
			- two stories, exterior appears fairly clean, some tables set up outside
			- notice board -- series of lectures posted, speaker is Jubilost Narthropple (noted historian and mapmaker)
				- next event scheduled for tomorrow afternoon tea
			- knocking on the door -- a gnome with curly dark brown hair answers
				- Negant Warthropple, assistant adjutant venture captain pro tempore
				- Caine asked about records of expeditions to the Tuskwater
					- Negant will show us the records, making us some tea first
					- Liosa will help look through the records
				- Liosa asked about anyone from Korvosa (trying to get to the bottom of that found spellbook)
					- Negant initially thought about Count Varian Jeggare, but remembered that he's not Korvosan but rather a Chilaxian noble and Pathfinder
- *Archie looking for interesting smithing techniques in the mercantile district*
	- nothing really of import
- *Garrett looking for info re: Bellflower Network*
	- receives a message that there will be contact after the meeting with Lady Minerva Lebeda
