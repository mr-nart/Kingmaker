## Summary
The party has another shared dream -- this time "The Guardian of the Bloom" is asking us to meet her (alone) at some location deep in the Narlmarch Forest to collect some kind of reward. We also had meetings with Lady [[Jamandi Aldori]], [[Kassil Aldori]], the Temple of Abadar, [[Kalto Orlovsky]], and [[Bertrand Cafagna]]. Garrett had a meeting with a "group of interested businessmen." Hedera and Valerie made acquaintances with a nixie named Melianse while investigating the mysterious vines.

## Log
**Aldori Manor**
- great hall has been repaired in the interim
- Lady Aldori and Hannis Drelev are there, they were discussing his plans
	- Hannis leaves us
- Jamandi Aldori's expectations regarding our kingdom:
	- "someone that might give us an advantage at the negotiating table with the Surtovas"
	- [[Natala Surtova]] has granted one person a "baron" title
	- [[Kassil Aldori]] - impeccably polite half-orc, Aldori's pupil -- Jamandi Aldori wants him as an envoy between us and the Aldori Swordlords
		- Archie brings up wanting Kesten -- Lady Aldori is hesitant to part with Kesten
			- if that were the case, would need to formally ally with Restov and essentially acknowledge its independence from Brevoy (when that time comes)
- we discussed The Black Tears + Rogerio
	- possible association with the Surtovas?
	- other info gathered about the ambush on the manor?
		- not that much is known, just that it is suspected they were paid by another party to disrupt the expeditions into the Stolen Lands for unclear reasons
- [[Bertrand Cafagna]] -- one of the Mivonese Swordlords
	- [[Mivon]] = kingdom to the south of the River Kingdoms, has the 2nd largest population of Aldori Swordlords, not friendly with Pitax

**DREAM??**
- foggy, we see the delicate silhouette of the green woman
	- "thank you for freeing me"
	- "i would like to personally grant you a boon. i ask that you come alone"
	- some location deep in the Narlmarch Forest...

#### 26th of Pharast, Fireday
**Kassil Aldori**
- meet with him at breakfast
- future heir of the aldoris? => had teaching in running things
- happy to join us in Verdanti and "educate \[us]" on how to rule a kingdom

**The Temple of Abadar**
- almost looks like a bank, with a grand white and gold motif
- a small chapel in the back -- on the altar is a set of locks and keys

**House Orlovsky**
- meeting with Celestine's cousin at the trading house
	- [[Kalto Orlovsky]] -- he is scholarly Celestine's cousin, a fan of the Pathfinder Society
		- wavy brown hair, affable, baby face
		- also a black sheep of the family; compared to Celestine he is similarly distanced from the family proper
		- doesn't really seem that interested in going to Verdanti tbh
	- Aedan -- husband of Kalto, rumors that he's a social climber (standing improved after marrying into House Orlovsky)
		- rumors seem relatively unfounded though from what Caine / Liosa have heard
		- his reputation is more just about his interest in occultism
		- seems to be genuinely interested in going to Verdanti
- they want to sit on the council??
- they want us to help them tame a dragon?? for the symbolic meaning of it (i.e. Brevoy was founded on the back of a dragon)
	- really it's the head of the house Lord [[Poul Orlovsky]] that wants it, sort of to stake a claim on ruling Brevoy maybe?
- they give Celestine a sturdy steel shield bearing the crest of House Orlovsky, gifted by her father

**Bertrand Cafagna**
- pretty face but with scars all over, bears two aldori dueling swords
- lectures us about the [[Six River Freedoms]], which were established by the [[Outlaw Council]] in [[Daggermark]]:
	- "say what you will, i live free" (freedom of speech)
	- "oathbreakers die" (people may persecute anyone who breaks an oath)
	- "walk any road, float any river" (all roads/rivers are free for travel)
	- "courts are for kings" (all who visit a river kingdom are subject to that kingdom's laws)
	- "slavery is an abomination" (no hellknights may hold office, and slaves that escape to the river kingdoms are truly free)
	- "you have what you hold" (robbery is okay, and it is different from burglary)

**Garrett's thing**
- letter notifying him to meet at The Smokehouse
- meets with a female dwarf named Cirra on behalf of GIB (group of interested businessmen)
	- AKA probably NOT Gottfried Ichabod Besler
	- they're a thieves' guild
	- they want to establish themselves in Verdanti
	- gives Garrett a small quiver containing cold iron arrows

> **Hedera and Valerie**
> - off to investigate the vines some more on the banks of the river
> 	- distinct from the surrounding vegetation, thicker and oilier, don't appear to be native
> 	- almost look like they have tubers?
> 	- Hedera makes a firebreak and lights some of the vines on fire
> 		- immediately hears a faint shriek in the distance?
> - they sneak off towards the shriek
> 	- there is a "copse of trees"
> 	- some of the "fallen branches" appear to be moving slowly -- walking and sniffing things around them???
> 		- they're [[Creatures#Twigjacks]] -- tiny fairies made of wood?
> 	- there's a blue creature there, too
> 		- it's a [[Creatures#Nixies|nixie]] -- an aquatic fey being
> - Hedera: "I come in peace, I wish to parlay", just trying to meet the neighbors
> 	- Melianse the nixie -- established a non-confrontational relationship, not really allies
> 	- but they'll stay out of each other's business for now
> - Hedera's getting tatted up (jk she's doing scarification)
> - Hedera sets out some alarm snares around the fort
> - Chief Sootscale and Pik'mek are examining Pik'tol:
> 	- no particularly revealing insights regarding the vines or the illness itself
> 	- need to ask about what Pik'tol was saying/writing?
