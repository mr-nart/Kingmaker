## Summary
The group takes more meetings with the Church of Erastil, House Surtova, and House Lodovka. It seems there might be some kind of espionage going on involving the Surtovas' butler "Rogerio" and someone with suspiciously placed makeup over their left cheek. We put in place a poorly thought out plan to have Nugget gather counter-intel. Hedera and the kobolds deal with some bandits.

## Log
#### 25th of Pharast, Oathday
**Bear and Pitch Inn** (rustic dining hall on the outskirts of Restov)
- Father [[Wochek Colehout]], young man early 30s, brown straight bowl cut, secretly jacked, impressive longbow
	- thankful for our work in the Greenbelt
- would like us to restore the [[Temple of the Elk]] in exchange for some food, lumber, help with a Grainery, help with agriculture (if we're sympathetic to Erastil, consider their holidays holy, set aside space for nature)

**Archie's brief reunion with Kesten**
- Archie asked Kesten if he'd like to come along
- Kesten would love to come, but Aldori needs him in Restov
- also dropped the info that Aldori is lending us some swordsmen
- they dap up (it was okay)

> **Hedera & Valerie**
> - some bandits(?) are attacking from across the river bank? seem to be former Staglord bandits
> 	- the kobolds + them take the bandits out

**Surtova Manor**
- Lord [[Suvarion Surtova]], brother [[Radamir Surtova]], brother's wife [[Nadya Surtova]]
- they want us to help "maintain the status quo" in Brevoy
	- offering large financial investment
	- offering "true" noble titles in the future
	- requesting Radamir be granted a leadership role to help set up the new kingdom + some land set aside for Radamir + Nadya to start a villa
	- requesting exclusion of agents of House Orlovsky (but Celestine is fine as long as she's an agent of Sarenrae independent of her family)
	- requesting fealty to King Noleski Surtova and acknowledgement of his rightful rule of Brevoy
- mustachioed man with a great smile in a white/blue tunic enters? [[Uthred Lodovka]], childhood friend (protector) of Radamir, probably having an affair with Nadya Surtova
	- offering food imports, trade relations
	- MUST accept offer from House Surtova
- one of the servants is taking notes? hands notes to someone behind a door, faintest hint of a glint of makeup on their cheek...
	- his name is Rogerio
	- we pretended to have dropped an important document in the manor, asked Rogerio (and other servants) to help look for it
	- we left Nugget in the manor, maybe he'll be able to hear something?
