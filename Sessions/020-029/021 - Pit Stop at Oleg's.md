## Summary
The group recovered Davick Nettle's spear. On the way back to Oleg's, we stumbled across some artifacts left at the base of a charred tree, presumably from a wizard trained at the Academae (a magic school in Korvosa). We returned to the trading post, with the intention to set off in the morning back to Restov. During this time, Hedera and Valerie have been continuing to secure the Tuskwater Fort and preparing living quarters for the sootscale kobolds they're planning to contract. While doing this, they were approached by a suspicious kobold who claims to be Pikmek, the cousin of Nakpik. He was looking for the pair of magical gnarled sticks.
