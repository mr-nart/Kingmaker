## Log
**Hedera & Valerie**
- Pikmek & Chief Sootscale + 12 others arrive at Tuskwater Fort on *20th of Pharast*, they agree to Hedera's terms, will assist with whatever is requested
	- Hedera's putting them to work at repairing fences, clearing up the tunnel, cleaning up the place, scavenging resources (they can keep 10%)

**Garrett**
- checks in on his warehouse at the docks, things seem to be going fine, needs to catch up on paperwork
- also will work on migrating his business over

**Caine & Liosa**
- Greenbelt expeditions date back thousands of years
	- most recent with Jamandi 40 years ago, fighting back an incursion from Galt + the bandits in their employ
		- many casualties, in particular one of Jamandi's compatriots (crossbowman, son of the Lord Mayor at the time), crossbow shattered into many pieces
	- Taldan imperial mining efforts
		- ore caches of gold, silver, (iron in the mountainous region to the east)
	- Dwarven settlement
	- records of cyclops once there in the area

**Meeting with Lady Minerva Lebeda**
- at The Silver Moon Inn
- Minerva, a woman with blond hair, fair complexion, sharp features, lips perpetually curled in a sardonic smile, purple gown
	- "you can refer to me as Minerva, but never Minnie"
	- "the sort of neighbor that Rostland is looking for is a sympathetic one"
	- "you are by no means puppet rulers, but we are hoping for at least some charitable relationship between our two nation-states"
	- King Surtova has to approve all land grants, there's another meeting @ Restov Trade Hall tomorrow night
		- there we can meet potential partners / investors
		- Minerva suggests avoiding allying with followers of Gorum -- may push us towards conflict
			- Amiri is a follower of Gorum
- leather folios around the table, containing agenda + dossiers on specific individuals we'll meet with tomorrow:
	- Ioseph Sellemius - 
	- Evan Garress - expect him to be accompanied by adopted heir, has mineral interests, note: do NOT bring up Kesten
	- Previn Surtova - leader of Church of Gorum in Rostland, values skill at arms above all else
- who are going to be the re-settlers?
	- some groups have formed, we should meet with them and figure out who we want to take with us...

>[!tldr|bg-c-gray]- Garrett's Bellflower thing
>- approached by halfling in a long coat, handed a piece of paper
>	- "Docks district, be sure to come alone." specifies a particular pier
>		- ~~Caine noticed Garrett trying to slink away... followed him...~~
>		- metallic entity meets Garrett there?? metallic lobster looking ass thing???? halfling was inside
>			- "you can call me 'Bud' ", he was very impressed with the whole slave smuggling thing
>			- she made it to Sevenarches
>		- he wants him to set up a "Sapling" branch there, they will want to smuggle people through
>			- could attract the attention of Hellknights

#### Next day, 24th of Pharast
- staying in Aldori manor, breakfast in the main hall
- Ioseph Sellemius arrives
	- has the charter for us to sign
	- has one request for us: "as part of extending this particular charter... we were hoping that you would consider having your nation establish trade relations with Restov formally and having a diplomatic envoy to exchange news"
- Hedera tries to give herself a tattoo... without much success
