## Summary
Scouting groups start to return to the [[Tuskwater Fort]]. One of the scouting groups had set off prior to Hedera enlisting the kobolds, consisting of [[Tik'tok]] and [[Knik'knak]].  They brought back Roc eggs, one of which Hedera intends to incubate, hatch, and ultimately raise. They also bring back intel about [[Maegar Varn]] starting up settlements in the mountains to the southeast. After a group brings back some info about a woman looking for fangberries and rattlecaps, a group goes off to forage, finding fangberries amidst hordes of chew spiders and a new friend(?), [[Nok-Nok]].

## Log
#### 27th of Pharast
- noise from outside the tuskwater fort, it's the alarm snares going off as sootscale kobolds return
	- Nak'pik's group that went West, only two came back
	- Nak'pik + one other kobold with big wooden sticks impaling her
	- "she was attacked by a tree!"
	- Hedera and Chief Sootscale help heal her
		- "oh, thank you! I thought dead"
	- big castle to the west of where they ran into Twigjacks? no smoke coming from the castle => maybe uninhabited?
		- 3 days travel
		- there is one body to retrieve, Hedera makes an empty promise to retrieve it for funeral rites

#### 31st of Pharast
- Tik'tok and Knik'knak returned to the silver mine, almost no one there but a few directed us to the tuskwater fort
	- we had been adventuring to the east to investigate some new sources of food for the tribe, found very large eggs + birds in the mountains southeast of the mine
		- brought back a couple of eggs, but the birds have been agitated by recent settlements in the mountains, so that cut our investigation a little bit short
			- the settlement was founded by mercenaries?? led by Maegar Varn (per eavesdropped conversation)
- now we make it back to the Tuskwater fort on the 31st of Pharast, clear day, getting warmer, 55*
	- Pik'tol welcomes us to "Fort Kobold" out from the distance as we're talking loudly next to an alarm snare
- Chief Sootscale brings us to meet "shiny coin lady" (Hedera)
	- Hedera fills us in on her contract with kobolds
- we present the eggs
	- Hedera identifies them as Roc eggs, they are both fertilized
		- Rocs are giant birds, 30 ft from beak to tail
	- we trade one egg for 1g 3s and keep the other one to eat

#### 1st of Gozran
- alarm snares go off, expedition to the South returns
	- they mention a big tower in the middle of the lake
	- mention seeing some Iruxi(?)
	- mention meeting some "big stick lady" that wanted specific mushrooms and berries in exchange for "shinies"
		- humanoid lady with a pointy hat and a big stick
		- provide a crude drawing of the mushrooms -- hollow top, "shake for noise" -- Knik'knak identifies it as a "rattlecap"
			- they seem to be poisonous, they made everyone sick
			- Hedera wants to forage for them, store them in a pit outside of the fort
			- last time Tik'tok and Knik'knak saw these mushrooms, they were in a muddy area far to the south with lots of other mushrooms
		- drawing of "fangberries"
			- very sweet, helps heal wounds 
- We feast on the egg!
- what do Knik'knak and Tik'tok know about the area?
	- goblins to the south
	- human hunter camp along the gudrin river to the east
	- trolls east of the lake
	- wolves that patrol south of the shrike river
- "have you ever heard of the words 'secret police'?" -- says Hedera
	- seems to be taking an interest in tik'tok and knik'knak
- overall plan: keep on working towards rebuilding the fort

**Foraging for berries**
- known thicket, takes 3/4 of a day to get to it
- a good number of berries have rotted
- Hedera takes some cuttings of the bushes to try to propagate back at the fort
	- notices spiderwebs, likely from Chew Spiders -- tik'tok and knik'knak have never encountered these spiders before
- goblin Nok-Nok is in the area, they've been here munching on berries for a while now
- some rustling sounds... fist-sized spiders in packs attack
	- we killed them eventually, Nok-Nok helped with the fight
- gathering berries
	- Tik'tok -- full basket
	- Knik'knak -- half basket
	- Nok-Nok -- half basket
