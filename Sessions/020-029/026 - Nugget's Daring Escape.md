## Summary
Nugget makes a daring escape out of the Surtova Manor. We are able to de-escalate the tense situation of the Surtovas' staff chasing him through the streets, albeit likely raising a little bit of suspicion in the process. Nugget was able to confirm Rogerio's association with what appear to be members of The [[Black Tears]], though the details are still not clear. On Hedera's end, she sends out some scouting parties to explore the nearby area. Additionally, one of the kobolds is acting strangely...
