## Summary
The party is headed towards Nettle's Crossing before going back to Oleg's, and ultimately Restov to give report of their expedition into the Greenbelt. On the way, we came across a wounded [[Ekundayo]], who has asked for our help in escorting him and his wolf to Oleg's after we defeated the troll he was hunting.

## Log
- plan is:
	- leave Valerie and Hedera behind to man the fort
	- take two horses with us, leave two horses at the fort
	- detour to Nettle's Crossing (to pick up the spear), then Oleg's to drop off Irenna / pick up Lander, then Restov
- after fording the river, there are some webbed footprints + some larger footprints (something that weighs at least 400 lbs)
	- i mean... seems like some bear killed a bird or something... why would we pursue this? we keep moving past it lol
- on the way to the crossing
	- dog is standing in our path? barks at the horses -- bruh that shit isn't a dog, that's a wolf
	- there are some wounds on the dog's side, jagged lacerations, trail of blood towards a nearby rock
		- dog wants us to follow it to the rock
		- unconscious man, obvious wound to his head
			- dark-skinned, bandages around his legs, looks like he is fairly pale, breathing shallowly
		- there's a shout in the distance in a language we don't understand + other commotion
			- Garrett sees a flash of green skin? -- It's a troll, we killed it with fire
				- blood-stained sack contents:
					- broken armor? broken wooden shield?
					- kukri -- black-ish hue to the metal, "cold iron"
				- blue leather bracers -- studded with some kind of scales
	- the dude's named [[Ekundayo]], goes by "Ekun", was out hunting the troll
		- says the troll owed him a debt, the troll was a servant of "[[Gragglebeard]]"
		- "I suppose you people are the sort that would meddle in your grandmother's dishes if she didn't oppose it"
		- would like to tag along with us to Oleg's
- we set up camp, the watches are quiet

> **at the fort**
> - Hedera and Valerie repair the gate
> - Hedera went off to recruit the kobolds -- promised to pay them in gold for their help
