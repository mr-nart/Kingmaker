## Summary
The group has enlisted the help of the sootscale kobolds, who may be willing to help scout out the Staglord's base. Our party has expanded for the time being with the addition of Lander and Valerie, who have revealed that Tartuccio's actions split up the party, leading to Jaethal and Harrim leaving on their own. Lander intends to return to Restov while Valerie plans to join us long-term. Valerie suspects Jaethal went to join Maegar Varn -- Harrim may have gone southwest in search of Dwarven ruins. Kressle has also joined the party, revealing her true name to be Irenna. Our next moves include trying to resolve the kobold / mitflit conflict, returning to Oleg's to check on them, going to Old Bokken's to get some potions, and then pursing the Staglord directly.

## Log
- bandit camps
	- to the West in the woods
	- to the East in near the river
- staglord has mist powers
	- gimp that throws lightning
	- Auchs
	- zombies
- kobolds are willing to scout out the Staglord's base for us, need a few days to rest up first, though

**Examining Lander/Valerie**
- multiple blunt force injuries, probably some kind of club, one of the clubs seems "femur shaped" (chief sootscale's weapon)
	- 2-3 days old
- Tartuccio was talking to them about using the kobolds to get the upper hand
	- showed them the kobold transformation trick
	- dazzled them with some kind of spell
	- when they came to, they were being beaten up by the kobolds
- what happened to the rest of the group?
	- some kind of argument when they were at Fort Sorenko, Jaethal and Harrim parted ways a day before the Kobold nonsense
		- Jaethal went south? Maybe to join up with Maegar Varn, Valerie suspects?
		- Harrim may have gone southwest? Said something about Dwarven ruins?
	- Lander's retainers -- "last I recall, I saw them with their throats slit"
- Lander would like to go back to Restov
- Valerie would like to join our group

**Executing Tartuccio**
- as a group we decided it best to execute Tartuccio now
- buried his body

**Asking Kressle about stuff**
- some infighting among lieutenants?
	- Akiros -- maybe could be turned?
- good chance the Staglord has his men out on raid now towards Oleg's
- where is the staglord from?
	- some village north of the Greenbelt?
	- has some gimp that summons things for him?
	- he has a lady he meets with, "he seems to think he has something over on her"
		- "it's probably some of the only times i've seen him smile"
		- "never seen her, only heard her voice"
			- ethereal quality to her voice, sounds like he has her trapped or something?
- Kressle is joining us???
	- Hedera is okay with this???
	- "I'll be good"
	- Svetlana is her sister?????????????
	- Her actual name is Irenna
- Biblos - "some guy that thinks he's some fucking wizard" "damn does he have a good swing with a hammer"

**"Alright gang, let's split up"**
