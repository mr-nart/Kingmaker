## Summary
Upon defeating the Staglord, the group starts to clean up the mess at the Tuskwater base. However, before much progress can be made, the earth begins to quake and zombies begin to attack (alongside a shadowy, seemingly intangible creature). In the basement below, an old man chants away with his staff, appearing to be the source of this mayhem.

*there's a sound outside the gate...*
- Hedera warns us, we draw our weapons
- Hedera launches an arrow, sinks into... something
	- earth begins to tremor
		- Akiros: "It's the crazy old bastard in the basement, he's the one that caused the earthquakes!"
	- the rustling brush grows louder and louder
	- decrepit bodies start crawling their way out of the ground... buncha zombies -- *there's a creature formed from shadow amongst them?* - has a medallion of a bloodshot eye fading in and out of view
		- we close the gate
- screaming down from the basement...
	- the two bandits bound down there appear to be struggling and gasping for breath, as if they're having their life drained
		- Hedera slits their throats
	- behind a locked door, a man is muttering, drawing patterns in the earth, seemingly creating the earthquakes
		- Hedera picks the lock and shoots him with an arrow
		- "his bow, his bow! it's you, you have his bow"
