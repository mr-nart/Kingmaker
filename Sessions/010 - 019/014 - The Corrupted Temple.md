## Summary
[[Jhod Kavkin|Jhod]] accompanied us to the [[Temple of the Elk]] to seek out Erastil's blessing. On the way, we picked up the confiscated goods we buried at the Thornriver camp. We've poisoned a crate of whiskey with fly agaric mushrooms. Prior to reaching the temple, we stopped at an abandoned hut that [[The Staglord]] had requested be burned down, where we uncovered some of his backstory. Upon reaching the temple, we found it had been corrupted. We addressed(?) the corruption, and have been joined temporarily by [[Tristian]], a follower of [[Deities#Sarenrae]] who had sought out the temple after sensing the trouble.

## Log
#### **8th of Pharast**, Moonday
- blizzard continues, fog approaching
- Garrett able to read Tartuccio's journal and share the information with Kesten
- Old Bokken arrived at Oleg's
	- exchanged some moon radishes for minor healing positions and bought some other goods
- the blizzard is intensifying and the fog continues moving northward
	- Garrett looking through his spyglass, not able to see into the fog
- weapon rune stuff
	- Archie able to transfer +1 rune from greataxe to Celestine's scimitar, however destroying the greataxe in the process
- repaired NW catapult (other functioning one from before was the SE catapult)
- by the end of the day, the blizzard has let up a little, but the fog has rolled into the area
- *asking Jhod about the guardian of the bloom*
	- Erastil's blessing? 
	- Temple of Elk -- Jhod's visions tell him it's somewhere southwest of here in the forest
		- Jhod's visions show the way to the temple somewhat infested with large dangerous frogs?
		- (we'll plan to pick up our loot at the Thornriver camp on the way)

#### **9th of Pharast**, Toilday
- 38F, blizzard continues to let up, still lots of snow on the ground
- start making our way towards the Thornriver camp -> Temple of Elk
	- Irenna seems like she might know the way... she may have been there before + the Staglord wanted her to burn down an abandoned house there???
		- unclear why, but surely must be important for such a specific request
- *Thornriver camp*
	- picking up our stashed loot
	- poisoning liquor with Fly agaric mushrooms -- to give as a "gift"?
	- looks like there has definitely been additional foot traffic here since we left...
		- one male humanoid's footprints, soft leather boots, seemed like they wandered aimlessly first before going westward

#### **10th of Pharast**, Wealday
- during the night, wolves howling in the distance but none approach the camp

**Abandoned Hut**
- broken placard in front -- in Fey, describes the tenants of the "Green Faith"
	- goal is to value nature above all, guide nature and humanity to grow in harmony
	- was the Faith that was most predominant in Glenwine before the town's destruction
- woodchopping block
- no signs of life
- front door hanging open
	- walking in, hut has arcane echoes of illusion / necromancy magic?? 3 items in particular
		- *shattered pot?*
			- acrid scent
			- Liosa touches the pieces -- the room appears to fill with silvery fog
				- she sees the image of a unkept, bald, bearded older man speaking sternly to a young boy
					- "i tell you, the next time you go out to hunt, you have to find it. you find the meat, and you bring it back here" "only speak when i ask you questions!" "i've given you too many chances"
					- smashes the pot over the boy's face -- it's burning and he can't stop it
					- "that's what you get. next time you'll listen..."
					- Hedera recognizes him as a druid *Nugrah* that used to live in Glenwine...
						- he had been kicked out of the druid circle after his behavior changed following the death of his wife during childbirth
		- *scourge (whip/lash)?*
			- Nugrah fleeing from a destroyed village with the boy + scourge in hand
			- we took the scourge with us
		- *spatter of blood?* - old, not recent
			- Nugrah spouting orders at the boy (now fully grown)
			- "you've done it all wrong, you've ruined the meat" "but you'll see, i'll discipline you just like I did before"
			- the young man wearing a stag-horn helmet says "no more, this time you listen" "i'm not your boy, i'm not your slave. you are the slave, you listen to me. don't speak unless you're spoken to"
			- beats Nugrah unconscious
	- loose drawer, contained a *medallion with a wolf's head*, similar in construction to staglord amulets
		- child's bloody handprint on it?
		- seems very familiar to Hedera...
	- *a small journal* hidden in the wall
		- appears to be Nugrah's, describes disgust toward the kind of man his son had become
		- ritual diagram? a ritual to hide things?
			- can make a chest appear to have a false bottom
			- could be reversed with some "common herbs"
				- Hedera's guess -- dill?
- grazing pasture, fence long fallen apart from disrepair
	- small mound, NOT human-sized
	- Garrett digs it up -> unveils a small wooden chest, locked, not trapped?
		- filled with a variety of glass bottles of minimal value and some dried, shriveled up flowers
		- dill -> false bottom disintegrates
			- a piece of bone with a cap on the end, rustling of paper inside when shaken
				- scroll of gecko grip
			- a ruby-set necklace
			- a +1 dagger
- *green etched leaf?* seems like a fresh leaf, doesn't appear to be a leaf from any nearby tree
	- illegible writing maybe?
	- Caine copies down the etching + makes a rubbing of it
	- Garrett pockets it

**Temple of Elk**
- brambles give way to a clearing, looming rock at the center
	- one face carved into the likeness of an elk encrusted with moss, with 50 ft wide cave entrance, stone steps
- large pool of water, thick with algae
- 3 large elk grazing on barren soil?
	- sickly purple-ish vine wrapping itself around them, into their ears, out their eyes
	- corpses dissolve after they're dispatched...
- sounds of fighting to the west? snapping of wolves and howling like a bellow of some large creature from inside the temple?
	- "Sarenrae protect me!" - some guy named Tristian
	- there's a huge "spectral bear", no vines but appears diseased and decaying
		- a corrupted guardian spirit, taking the form of a bear
		- upon being defeated, transforms into an old human man looking peaceful before crumbling into a skeleton -> dust
- after the guardian turns to dust, wildflowers bloom and pool becomes crystal-clear, sounds of birdsong fill the area
	- the fog around the area seems to be burning away?
- shallow cave with 5 pedestals and a narrow tunnel that leads deeper inside
	- middle pedestal with a leather cloak over it -- *Aerial Cloak*
		- Jhod: "I think this is a relic with Erastil's blessing. I suppose heroes such as yourselves might be able to benefit from it"
		- 
	- the other pedestals are completely empty
	- Jhod: "I think there was a sacred relic here once"
		- was it the stag helmet??????
- [[Tristian]]
	- "praise Sarenrae"
	- says he came to the Temple of Elk because Sarenrae guided him there, sensed some kind of corruption
	- will accompany us for the time being
- **The crystal-clear pool:**
	- Hedera takes a sip -- feels damn good
	- it's healing water
- **The narrow tunnel deeper in**
	- private altar with stag skull + bronze bow + bronze arrow
	- wooden box underneath
		- small buckler -- *Caster's Targe*
			- wooden shield w/ panel on the inside that allows for writing -- can be imbued with a spell like a scroll
	- Hedera asks for a moment alone in the altar
