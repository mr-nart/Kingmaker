## Summary
The party had another shared dream, this time with the mysterious figure showing her face and revealing herself to be "The Guardian of the Bloom." We traveled back to [[The Old Sycamore]] with our fake stick in hand. We managed to "return" it and barter peace between the [[Creatures#Sootscale Kobolds]] and the [[Creatures#Mitflits]] (for now?). We started back towards Oleg's, finding some gold nuggets and dispatching some thylacines on the way.

## Log
**What's the plan?**
- go to the Sycamore tree? if they're hostile, I guess we kill them -- if not, we try to trick them with a fake stick
- then Oleg's?
- then Old Bokken's?

#### 6th of Pharast, Starday
- overnight, fog rolls in
- **DREAM!**
	- a face... olive-colored, appears to be in horrible pain
	- reaches out - "please, save me. the staglord -- he has me prisoner. i beg of you adventurers, help."
		- Liosa: "how?"
			- "the staglord - he has captured a portion of my power, and with it, he commands some of my allegiance. However, Erastil's blessing may be able to help you free me"
			- "who are you?"
			- "The Guardian of the Bloom"
		- Garrett: "where are you held"
			- "deep in the Staglord's camp at the banks of the tuskwater"
		- Archie: "he steals the powers and tries to make them his own, but beware of his archery"
- the title "the guardian of the bloom" would be a title taken on usually by a nymph or other fey creature who has taken it upon themselves to protect the natural world
- per Irenna: the staglord thinks he and the lady are in love
- Archie's stick looks pretty similar to the actual stick...
- Liosa and Caine not really able to identify the sticks other than that they're probably attuned to the 1st world, want to come together, can be activated

**To the old sycamore**
- Nak'pik is joining us
- when we get there, mitflits are standing guard outside, threaten towards us menacingly
	- "begone, evil"
	- Garrett: "we come to return what was stolen"
	- "put stick" pointing at ground
	- they seemed to buy it... dancing in a circle, celebrating, hug Nak'pik
- Nak'pik is unaware that we returned a fake stick
- Liosa wants to ask the mites about the sticks
	- Nak'pik calls for someone to come up
	- out comes "Magestic Queen Ba-dah" -- wearing remnants of wedding dress and a wagon wheel on her head
	- Garrett has Nak'pik tell her that there was a rogue Kobold who was to blame for the conflict, and he has been taken care of
	- "not mad, just disappointed"
	- "stick very powerful. legend say it is the symbol of mite royalty. with it, Queen Ba-dah's rule is secure"
	- "stick also has connection said to be used to unlock chamber where somebody very powerful has stored a treasure"
	- "long ago this was entrusted to the mites, and we have kept it safe ever since"
	- "their name (the person who gave it to the mites) is lost to time"
- things seemed smoothed over for now
- Nak'pik takes his leave back to their base

**Back to Oleg's through the woods**
- decided to take the slightly longer wooded path since we've traveled that way before and it provides cover
- looking for somewhere to camp out as we near the woods
	- Liosa sees a crack in a crag at the foot of some hills?
		- opens up into a crevice, widens as it goes deeper
		- Archie starts throwing fire into the hole -- Caine: "wait why don't we just have Liosa make light..." -- too late
		- some kind of glittering rock wall inside?
		- Liosa sends her bird familiar, doesn't really return with anything
		- Garrett willing to rappel down -- cave with a golden wall, sound of water dripping softly in the distance, feels moist
			- dome-shaped, faint hint of a foggy tendril of light farther into the cave
			- no tunnels going anywhere significant
			- chips away a gold-seamed chunk of stone -- per Archie it's definitely gold, able to extract a thumb-sized chunk of gold
	- plan to camp just outside this gold vein cave
		- Garrett trying to chisel out the gold vein, another chunk obtained
		- Archie making an elemental familiar from the gold nugget
		- Hedera making a batch of alarm snares, not finished yet
		- Caine foraging for foodstuffs
		- Celestine cooking a hearty meal

#### 7th of Pharast, Sunday
- bitterly cold, fog moving northward, howls / yipping bark in the distance overnight, getting closer
- thylacines, seems like the cave was their lair? attacked overnight
	- we kicked their butt, got some pelts and meat from them
