## Summary
We made our way to the Tuskwater. Made it through the front gate (Dovan let us in). We brought in our poisoned booze. The Staglord's crew is currently partying? We escorted our "prisoners" to the basement, but are now making our way up the base. We raided the armory. We are on our way up to the Staglord. We managed to talk to Akiros, unfortunately he does not seem to want to help -- he said we're not fooling anyone and that we should leave now while we still have the chance. There is a caged owlbear on this floor.
