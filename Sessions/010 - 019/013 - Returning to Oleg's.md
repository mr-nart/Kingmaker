## Summary
A cold front has hit, bringing heavy snowfall. As we approached [[Oleg's Trading Post]], we found that [[Kesten Garess|Kesten]] and some reinforcements were there to help defend. Kesten revealed the conclusion of the investigation into [[Tartuccio]], which confirmed him to be the Pitaxian spy. The party was able to return Svetlana's ring and reunite the two sisters, who were able to make up. She'll continue journeying with us for the time being, at least until we deal with [[The Staglord]]. Another dream came to us, urging us to seek out [[Deities#Erastil]]'s blessing.

**Dream**
- "help, help me"
- stunningly beautiful nymph, green skin layered with vines, otherworldly appearance
- "The land is being choked. The fog stifles what little is left. please, if you have the strength, i urge you to stop what the Staglord and his servant druid have been doing. They seem to have somehow corrupted my power. They're turning the land against itself. If you wish to undo their spell upon the land, I urge you to seek out Erastil's blessing. It's the only way that you'll be able to break this spell."
	- "The temple of the Elk - an ancient place sotted with Erastil's power. The priest - the bald one - he knows the way. He can guide you."
