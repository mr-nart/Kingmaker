## Summary
We finished off the zombies, shadows, and Nugrah. The attack seems to be the work of a follower of [[Deities#Gyronna]], who may have previously inhabited the [[Tuskwater Fort]]. The lock of green hair clearly has something supernatural about it, but it's unclear how or if it is tied to the ambush by the undead. We let Akiros go freely, much to Hedera's disdain. The Staglord's body was given to a mysterious undead figure by the riverbank named Davick Nettles.

## Log
- fighting continues
	- the shadow thing is pulling at people's shadows
		- some kind of undead, not like an elemental thingy, seems to be leading these zombies
		- it stole Celestine's shadow, which is now fighting us as well
		- Garrett felt the hairs in his pocket tugging towards the gate
	- Nugrah is summoning shit in the basement
		- he has some kind of oaken armor that is helping him survive Hedera's shots?
		- knocked Irenna down, is now absorbing her life essence or something???
			- Garrett got her back up with a potion
	- WE DID IT!! -- took Nugrah down finally
	- Celestine's shadow returned to her

**on Nugrah's person**
- club
- wooden and blood-stained disk -- symbol of Gozreh
	- one of the anathema is creating undead...?

**outside the front gate**
- lots of disturbed earth from where the zombies emerged, some fallen trees
- we burn ALL the bodies
- Archie repairs the gate, we barricade it with the wagons

**the green hairs**
- garrett takes them out, a breeze picks up and carries them away
	- one goes to the Staglord's body, the others fly away

**Akiros / Irenna's info**
- the original building where the base is wasn't built by the bandits
- they had heard beforehand that the building was a hub of supernatural activity
- Akiros' story
	- was training to be a Paladin of Erastil, but there was a tragedy in his home village (in Galt)
		- "I once was a servant of Erastil, but I doubt he would consider me worthy of faith at this point"
		- Garrett encouraged him to visit the temple to Erastil and pray there if he likes
	- was looking for a place to belong, thought the Staglord would bring order
	- thinks of the government of Restov as "tyrants"
	- "\[the city] is just not for me. I find that things get complicated when you put so many people together... It's safer out here."
	- "I think the Greenbelt is already settled, or at least, we had already settled it. I thought these were men who deserved the chance to have their independence."
	- "If I have your permission to go, I was planning to go my own way."
- we let Akiros go
	- Irenna says "Akiros was the only good one here..."
	- Garrett has a little heart-to-heart with Hedera about this + having Irenna in the party

**Writing on the wall**
- ancient taldane, worn down: monks that were servants of Gyronna, faith not sufficient for their obligations
- in Elven written in blood: "My God, she's taken all of us. I'm the last one, and I'm next"

**By the river**
- figure standing by the banks from a distance, pointing at us
	- humanoid, maybe a man dressed in rags? looks soaked in water
	- we've seen this thing before, we suspected it was something related to the demigod of the Sellen River, Hanspur 
		- "I want his body. The Staglord. Bring him to me."
	- getting closer, bringing the body, it's clearly undead
		- "Bring me the body! He has done my family wrong, and I need justice. They were innocent, did nothing! And he burned us anyway. 5 years ago."
		- "If a prize is what you wish, I have a treasure buried at my house. A spear. On the river crossing to the East."
		- name is Davick Nettles
	- Garrett and Hedera bring the body, rolls it into the River
		- Davick takes the body down beneath the surface

#### **14th of Pharast, Wealday**
- night passes without incident
- the morning comes with an overcast sky, 33*
- in the cellar:
	- damp, thick with cobwebs, random chests and crates and bags
	- chest -- filled with lots of coins
	- crates -- mundane trade goods, including pelts, furs, tobacco, iron, bronze, tools, lots of stolen stuff basically
	- bag -- stolen jewelry, 30gp worth
