## Summary
The party made it to the [[Kobold Warrens]] where we apprehended [[Tartuccio]], disguised as a purple kobold named Tartuk, with the help of Mikmek and chief Sootscale. We recovered what appears to be Tartuccio's journal, though it's written in Undercommon. [[Lander Lebeda]] and [[Valerie]] were there -- beaten, barely conscious, captive, and likely betrayed by the gnome. No sign of the remainder of their group so far: [[Jaethal]] and [[Harrim]].

## Log
**5th of Pharast**
- travelling south to Kobold Warrens
- Tartuk (likely Tartuccio)
	- rose to power after helping defeat the queen of the mitflits
	- supposedly has magic, is a follower of Old Sharp Tooth
	- powers: can levitate, make illusions to scare mitflits, breathe fire, make wind
	- *wait, where is the rest of Tartuccio's party?*
- Linzi doesn't really think Tartuccio seems very Pitaxian
	- not the right accent, seems too foppish
- we filled in Mikmek on our suspicion that Tartuk is Tartuccio (did not mention that he's a gnome)
- led up to the entrance of what looks to the "Oak Top Silver Mine"
	- cage at the entrance that contains a single sobbing mitflit
	- Mikmek vouches for us to Nakpik at the entrance, we're let in

- **Kobold Warrens**
	- temple to Old Sharp Tooth with charcoal/blood drawings on walls
	- led up to a campsite within the cave, group of kobolds there, one of them is wearing a large carved bone-y hat adorned with feathers, carrying some kind of axe + a large bone
		- the chief (Chief Sootscale)
	- "oh you have old sharp tooth, we won't fall to the curse"
	- "we have been told he is angry at us for losing him, if we don't get the statue back he will cause us to turn yellow and die"
	- treasures are kept with the priest
	- the kobolds are holding "big talls" as prisoners?
		- Tartuk captured them...
		- we round a corner, we see two tied up prisoners, appears to be Lander and Valerie, appear to be beaten heavily, barely conscious...
	- preist's room
		- purple scaled kobold next to a boiling cauldron, acrid odor...
		- sounds like Tartuccio speaking draconic...
		- some disagreement between Tartuk and Chief Sootscale about our party's standing...
		- Tartuk was the one that instigated the war?, in order to take some kind of magic stick
		- Garret with the glowing mithril+statue in his bag: "Oh... I hear you old sharp tooth!"
	- we take down Tartuk with the help of Chief Sootscale and Mikmek
	- gave the statue back to the chief
		- he smashes the statue... "no more, sharp tooth was going to curse us. no more. we do not have to be beholden to them"
		- *inside the statue was small piece of gnarled wood?*
			- feels like it's vibrating, responding strongly to the entire area? like it's a powerful link to the stolen lands itself
			- Liosa gets the sense that it's extraplanar?
	- freed Lander + Valerie
	- *Tartuccio was doing some kind of ritual? unclear what it was for*
		- hastily painted sigils around the room, mentioning links to the First World and the Fey -- conjuration of something?
	- treasure pile:
		- 2 enchanted arrows
		- coins
		- rune stone
		- soiled bag
			- small pouch, filled with a very shiny dust, (illusion magic?)
			- *Svetlana's ring*, brass ring set with a single pearl
			- 1 platinum
		- journal, presumably Tartuccio's
			- locked -- Garret picks it
			- written in undercommon
				- per Mikmek -- talks about a very heroic gnome, wanting to be a big shot, please patron?, become baron, use kobolds to become baron, he will laugh many times for giving present to stupid elf, sticks will unlock what patron wants, want to make first impression good with patron
	- Tartuccio's belongings:
		- gnarled stick, similar to the one inside the statue -- he had used it to cast magic missile
		- a key
		- a broken crossbow w/ runic carvings, ornate "R"
