## Summary
Finalized(?) characters, set campaign expectations. Did some individual RP to get us all to the Aldori Manor. Caine learned vague information of the Black Tear's plot to remove the swordlords (and elves?) from Rostland in the name of Issia. Next up is finding a way into the Aldori party and/or alerting them of what may transpire.

## Log
- "may be scenes related to violence against women and children / depictions of torture / child abuse / neglect / substance abuse"
	- will NOT allow sexual violence or intimate scenes -- if they happen, will be a "fade to black"
	- "will probably be around an R-rated movie"
- how often will we meet?
	- probably twice a month as a goal, will try to pencil in for evenings, generally friday nights
	- cancellations will happen probably if over 2 players absent (or the GM lol)
	- goal of 5 hours/session

#### Table expectations
- broad campaign, not super comedic all the time, lots of drama & austere environments
- bad guys aren't just waiting for us to do stuff -- they will keep doing stuff if we're dicking around lol
- feel free to jump in to narrate your actions
- please try o make characters that will work together
	- Jess will run pvp if needed

#### Scene setting
- we're all headed to Restov, the last major outpost of civilization on the southern edge of Brevoy
	- lots of backstory about brevoy, see the dedicated page for the history lesson lol
	- the Aldori Swordlords have been scheming in the background to try to take back Rostland

#### Caine's start
- [[Investigating the Black Tears]]...
	- conglomeration of several gangs of New Stetven ~5 years ago
	- have some kind of draconic tattoo on their forearms
	- big operation in Restov?
		- on the trail, found several victims w/ specific kinds of injuries that could only have been some kind of ritual
	- Bounty letters -- pay a price, dead or alive, for capture of Black Tears agents
- In Restov
	- currently staying at "The Silver Moon Inn", reviewing evidence
		- letter on a victim? cryptic text -- referenced a meeting on the docks @ midnight in 2 days for a transaction? ritual materials? some sort of smuggling has to take place? ("hot cargo")
- Caine on the docks, sneaking up to the warehouse
	- office entrance? double doors for carts? side door? some windows (some on a second story)
		- can't hear much of anything behind side door -- except for some faint snoring
		- through the window near the side door, a light on deep inside the building, some papers on office desk
		- other windows, seems like the light source is in the main hall of the warehouse -- NOT in the office, but some of it shines through to there
	- hiding spots? tiny bell tower... another warehouse 15 ft away (maybe hide on the roof)... alcove... some crates
		- hiding in the alcove
	- at midnight, 3 people approaching w/ a light
		- one normal looking dude + 2 big dudes unlocking office entrance, don't appear to have noticed me
		- 10 minutes later, some guy looking around furtively
			- maybe some sort of academic -- appears to be of a relatively higher social standing
				- knocks 3 times, then twice w/ a specific rhythm
			- sounds of talking inside... i sneak up
				- lively discussion, haggling over the price of "**a giant's mantle**"?? not sure what that is...
				- "100 to 200 gold" "research... better able to understand giant magic"
			- back to the alcove now, next few minutes pass without incident
	- academic walks out with a tightly rolled bundle in his hands
		- seemingly out of nowhere, a figure approaches?? ambush...
		- academic exsanguinated, i knocked out the ambusher who appears to be a member of the Black Tears
- **interrogating Black Tears guy**
	- forearm tattoo in draconic says "live free or slaughter"
	- tattoo of 3 tears near his left eye
	- snuck inside other warehouse, pulled him in as well
		- removed weapons from the black tears guy -- 2 daggers, hand crossbow, some bolts
		- letter -- "deliver the mantle to the Aldori manor before tomorrow night"
	- wakes up after 30 minutes
		- sacrifices -- "certain magics require sacrifice"
			- "these sacrifices are to get rid of bastards like you, put back into power the real people who should be in charge"
			- "we're gonna take down these stupid rostlanders, they're so dead"
			- "that stupid half-elf jamandi aldori sitting so smug... you think restov is safe from issia? no, they are so dead"
			- "they'll have some stupid party, that's when they'll strike"
	- after getting info, Caine killed the guy, took the Giant's mantle, plan to get into the Aldori manor party somehow
