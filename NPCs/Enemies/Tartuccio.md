- **He/Him** -- Gnome -- Adult

>One of the adventurers called upon for the expeditions into the [[Stolen Lands]]. *He is a spy from Pitax*, though he claims to be a business-gnome from [[New Stetven]] dealing in mostly magical goods, though Caine has never heard of him or his business. **Executed by our party on the 5th of Pharast.**

## Traits
Clearly has some sort of superiority complex. *Susceptible to flattery*, and particularly impressed by things relating to magic. *Racist against elves*.

Alternate form: purple kobold, went by the name of "Tar'tuk".

## Motivations
He is almost certainly a spy from [[Pitax]] given that he framed [[Caidaranel Novori|Caine]] after the [[Black Tears]]' attack on Aldori Manor.

Was trying to perform some kind of ritual in the [[Oak Top Silver Mine]] -- something to do with The First World / Fey?

## Affiliations
- possible affiliation with the [[Black Tears]]
