- **He/Him** -- Human -- Young adult?

>A member of [[Brevic Noble Houses#House Lebeda]], though noted to be a "black sheep" of the family. One of the adventurers called upon for the expeditions into the [[Stolen Lands]].

## Traits
Arrogant. Refers to himself as the "heir to House Lebeda." Seems pretty dumb.

## Motivations
Hopes that the efforts to colonize the [[Stolen Lands]] will help unify [[Brevoy]] -- "a common enemy will help bring us together."

## Affiliations
- [[Brevic Noble Houses#House Lebeda]]
- [[Celestine Orlovsky]] -- she has some kind of beef with Lander?
