- **She/Her** -- Human -- Adult

>**Irenna**, also known as Kressle, is a reformed(?) bandit originally affiliated with [[The Staglord]]. Captured during combat with bandits, now cooperating with our party.

## Traits
Known for her proficiency with dual-wielding hatchets and with a bow. Described by Happs (another bandit and former villager of Glenwine now deceased) as "having a bit of a mean streak."

## Motivations
Remorseful? States she would like to "make it up" to Svetlana. At the very least, she helped us take down the Staglord. Afterwards, she decided to stay at Oleg's with her sister.
