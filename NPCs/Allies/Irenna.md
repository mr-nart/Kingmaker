- **She/Her** -- Human -- Adult

>**Irenna**, also known as Kressle, is a reformed(?) bandit originally affiliated with [[The Staglord]]. Captured during combat with bandits, now cooperating with our party.

## Traits
Known for her proficiency with dual-wielding hatchets and with a bow. Described by Happs (another bandit and former villager of Glenwine now deceased) as "having a bit of a mean streak."

## Motivations
Remorseful? States she would like to "make it up" to her sister Svetlana. At the very least, she helped us take down the Staglord.

## Affiliations
