- **He/Him** -- Gnome -- Adult

>One of the adventurers called upon for the expeditions into the [[Stolen Lands]]. Claims to be a business-gnome from [[New Stetven]] dealing in mostly magical goods, though Caine has never heard of him or his business.

## Traits
Clearly has some sort of superiority complex. *Susceptible to flattery*, and particularly impressed by things relating to magic. *Racist against elves?*

## Motivations
He is almost certainly a spy from [[Pitax]] given that he framed [[Caidaranel Novori|Caine]] after the [[Black Tears]]' attack on Aldori Manor.

## Affiliations
- possible affiliation with the [[Black Tears]]
