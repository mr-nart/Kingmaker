The Aldori Swordlords arose when famed swordsman [[Historical Figures#Baron Sirian Aldori]] agreed to train a select group of pupils in his dueling techniques. They ruled [[Brevoy#Rostland]] for generations. Though they are considered some of the finest swordfighters in the Inner Sea region, they are also obsessed with personal standing and honor.

## Members
Those who wish to become a swordlord must take the last name of Aldori, swear to the Aldori swordpact, and demonstrate skill at swordplay by winning a duel using only a sword in the presence of a current member or experienced exile. No member is allowed to teach their techniques to any individual not belonging to this strict pact.
