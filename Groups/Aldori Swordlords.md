>The **Aldori Swordlords** arose when famed swordsman [[Historical Figures#Baron Sirian Aldori]] agreed to train a select group of pupils in his dueling techniques. They ruled [[Brevoy#Rostland]] for generations. Though they are considered some of the finest swordfighters in the Inner Sea region, they are also obsessed with personal standing and honor. In recent history, the group has been making furtive plans to take back control of Rostland.

>Plan to establish a dueling school in [[Nomen Heights]] once [[Maegar Varn]] is able to secure the area.

## Notable Members

No member is allowed to teach their techniques to any individual not belonging to this strict pact.
