>The **sootscale kobolds** are a group of charcoal-colored kobolds who our group met in the [[Oak Top Silver Mine|remnants of the Oak Top Silver Mine]], led by Chief Sootscale. Their mythology includes the worship of a winged hero named Old Sharp Tooth, though recent events involving a false prophet named [[Tartuccio|Tartuk]] may have sullied that traditional faith.
