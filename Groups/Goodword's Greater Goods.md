>**Goodword’s Greater Goods** is a small river shipping company owned by [[Garrett Goodword]] that began operating out of [[Restov]] in 4705. The company quickly gained a reputation for being both trustworthy and discreet when transporting both cargo and passengers around the waterways of the River Kingdoms. Goodword’s Greater Goods also grew to be well-liked by the halfling community in Restov for giving back to the community and employing primarily halflings while helping those down on their luck find a new place in life and truly embracing acting for the *Greater Good*.
