>The **Black Tears** are a crime syndicate created from the merging of smaller gangs in the city around 4705 AR. Members appear to be branded by forearm tattoo bearing the words *"Live Free or Slaughter"* in Draconic. Members may or may not have *tattoos of tears* below their eyes. Apparently are working towards removing the [[Aldori Swordlords]] from power (and removing elves from Brevoy?), a scheme which somehow involves *sacrificial rituals* and a [[Notable Items#Giant's Mantle]].
