>The **Pathfinder Society** is a globe-spanning organization that consists of adventurers who travel throughout Golarion to explore, delve, and otherwise experience the lesser-seen parts of the world. Chapters of the society are run by venture-captains, who assign missions and suggest new places to explore. The most exciting and illuminating of the reports written by members are compiled in the *Pathfinder Chronicles*, an ongoing series of books that collect the history and mystery of Golarian for the general public.

## Structure
The Grand Lodge in Absalom is the center of all Pathfinder Society activity and the meeting place for the **Decemvirate**, the ruling body made up of 10 experienced members whose identities and motives are traditionally shrouded in secrecy for their own safety.

Despite the presence of a central governing body, most matters are handled locally by *venture-captains*. The Decemvirate typically only functions as a disciplinary tribunal and high-level planning committee. Because of the relatively decentralized authority, the immediate goals and public perception of the various branches vary widely.
